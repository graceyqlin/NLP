"New York City Dept of Health and Mental Hygiene's efforts to compile detailed portrait of city's health runs into unexpected trouble; canvassers report problems trying to get representative sample, especially in well-off neighborhoods where people are too busy, too wary and just too hard to reach; photos (M) ","By actually measuring people,'' once and for all we'll now the true, accurate picture of obesity in New York City,'' Dr. Thorpe said. City health officials say that in poorer neighborhoods, some uninsured people view the survey as a chance for some free health care they would not otherwise get. The survey teams will keep returning to those areas until they have enough participants, city officials say.''The doormen usually turn us away,'' said Lynnette Gonis, one of the survey takers.' Alex said he'' was n't interested'' in taking part in the survey."
"Gov James E McGreevey, whose insistence on staying in office until Nov 15 set off political, legal and public relations challenges, needs only to remain in office until midnight Sept 3 to outlast state deadline that would automatically force special election to choose his successor; his announcement Aug 12 that he was stepping down because of extramarital affair with unidentified man led to coup attempt from within his own party, which he has managed to fend off; Richard J Codey, Senate president and fellow Democrat, will complete final 14 months of McGreevey's term under provisions of New Jersey's Constitution; photos (M) ","A former homeland security aide to the governor, Golan Cipel, said later that Mr. McGreevey had sexually harassed and assaulted him in 2001 and 2002.Under New Jersey's Constitution, when a statewide elected official leaves office more than 60 days before Election Day, a special election must be convened. Given that precedent, and the bitter reaction the swap of candidates caused among many voters, Republicans are still hoping that Mr. McGreevey can be forced from office within the next month so they can petition the court to call a special election anyway.'' Many legal experts say they consider it very unlikely that a federal judge would intervene in a matter involving a sitting governor, especially when the State Constitution spells out the criteria for special elections."
Women wearing miniskirts describe how to sit on subway seat with modicum of grace and modesty; photos (M) ,"This peculiar choreography is the daily routine for women wearing miniskirts-- extremely short miniskirts-- as they try to grab a subway seat with all the grace and modesty they can muster. Her first miniskirt purchase was only last month, after a friend gave her a gift certificate to Bloomingdale's. You always have to be adjusting,'' she said, tugging at her cotton black flower print miniskirt as she waited at Union Square for the subway.'' Those subway grates can blow up miniskirts the same way they got Marilyn Monroe's dress. It is far more likely to stick to the seats or be caught in a compromising position, miniskirt fans say."
Anna Kisselgoff reviews American Ballet Theater's recent season; photo (M) ,"This discrepancy is as it should be; City Ballet's style, with its blazing extended silhouette, is crisper than the harmonious textbook manner of Ballet Theater. By contrast, Ballet Theater's overly reverential staging of'' Ballet Imperial'' in 1988 looked as if it were being danced in 1941, the year of its creation. Ballet Theater, unlike City Ballet, still uses Rouben Ter-Arutunian's scenic images of St. Petersburg to amplify the tribute paid by Balanchine to Petipa's ballets. Astutely, this program distilled what has happened to Ballet Theater in the last two years. The equally weird counterpart to this work was another multilayered ballet:'' The Elements,'' In this sense, Ms. Tharp summed up the Ballet Theater season as a whole."
Laurel Graeber reviews The Nutty Professor as a movie for children (S) ,"The Nutty ProfessorEddie Murphy, Jada Pinkett Directed by Tom Shadyac PG-13 95 minutesMr. Murphy plays Sherman Klump, the bumbling, kindhearted chemistry professor created by Jerry Lewis in the 1963 film of the same name. But in this remake, Sherman is also horrifically obese, thanks to makeup and special effects. Trying to win the heart of a beautiful young graduate student ( Ms. Pinkett ), he makes himself the experimental subject for his latest research project: a weight-loss formula that restructures DNA. For Which Children?AGES 6- 9 Laboratory hamsters' antics and a running joke about flatulence appeal directly to the sense of humor of elementary school students, but do n't take them unless you want them imitating Mr. Murphy's vocabulary and sound effects at the dinner table."
"Alex Ross article on the avant-garde music scene in California; comments on San Francisco Symphony's recent festival of American music, where composer Henry Cowell was heavily represented and members of the Greatful Dead jammed with the orchestra; Cowell photo (M) ","But sometimes music manages to communicate a mysteriously exact sense of place. What was no less striking in the San Francisco survey was its attachment to the wayward but powerful tradition of experimental music in California. The beginning of the California school is usually dated to a 1914 concert at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco, at which the 16-year-old Cowell made a piano resound with ultradissonant chords made up of'' tone clusters.'' It is another paradox that the ideas of the ultimate New Englander took deepest root in the sandier soil of California. Other California composers tread perilously close to the vacant warbling and noodling of New Age. What is great in this California avant-garde often can not be separated from what is weak. No one can come to know American musical history without listening to California."
William Zimmer reviews retrospective exhibition of paintings and works on paper by Andrew Forge at Yale Center for British Art; photos (M) ,"His animated brush work competed with the subject of a painting for viewers' attention. The early figures were always women ( at least in the paintings on display ). The dot has continued to hang there, joined by countless others put through vigorous paces. The gist of Mr. Hollander's argument is that Seurat began with subject matter and a methodical approach to laying down his chromatic dots. The artist made paintings of the IRT and BMT lines. But both stayed with the painting a long time-- Mr. Forge's main intention. Now days, this work, composed with individual dots, might be likened to computer art made up of individual pixels. For the past 10 years Mr. Forge has been making a series of paintings on the subject of the months of the year."
Alberta Eiseman reviews exhibition of British teapots at Wilton (Conn) Historical Society; photos (M) ,"Traditions in Elegance: Two Centuries of British Tea Pots'' on view through Aug. 25 at the Wilton Historical Society in Wilton, illustrates how very much things have changed since tea was introduced to the Western world in the 17th century. Moreover, several period rooms in the Sloan-Raymond-Fitch House, headquarters of the Historical Society, have been arranged to illustrate the role of tea drinking in North America from Colonial days through the 19th century. British ships began regular sailings to China in the 17th century and by 1658 a drink called tea could be purchased in London. How tea drinking crossed the ocean is evoked in the society's period rooms, which have been reinterpreted to enhance the theme of the exhibition."

Most other sports that require combinations of strength and fitness-running, rowing and cycling- are typically dominated by those in their late 20's and early 30's. In fact, the normal pattern in swimming-of stellar teen-agers burning out by their early 20's- is an anomaly in the larger context and may reflect as much on training techniques, the early start swimmers get and the consequent physical and mental fatigue.

"Gerry Morrissey letter defends Michelle Smith, the Irish gold medal Olympic swimmer, against the charges of using drugs; photo (S) ","To the Sports Editor: Those of us who have lived in Europe and have thus enjoyed balanced, informed and comprehensive coverage of previous Olympic Games are variously amused and irritated by the jingoistic'' how many medals did we win today?'' A smear campaign, without any basis in fact, was being mounted against the Irish swimmer Michelle Smith, who had committed the crime of winning three gold medals that were apparently American property. The Times, July 23 ), Dave Anderson seemed to attribute Janet Evan's failure to win a medal herself in the 400-meter freestyle entirely to Michelle Smith. The claim that Michelle Smith ahs appeared from nowhere to win gold medals is simply untrue; she has been a world-class performer for years. America will win enough medals in Atlanta."

"Pres Clinton has had little interest in undoing remarkably successful strategy of Republican predecessors to remake nation's courts by selecting judges known for conservative views, as many supporters hoped he would; while he has promoted diversity in judiciary, most notable aspect of his appointments has been his reluctance to fill courts with liberal judges (M) ","Professor Songer and his colleagues, Robert A. Carp of the University of Houston and Ronald Stidham of Appalachian State University, then tabulated the decisions and concluded that among district court judges, President Carter's appointees rendered liberal decisions in 53 percent of their cases. In studying the appeals courts, the level below the Supreme Court, the study found that Carter judges rendered liberal rulings in 43.6 percent of all cases and Clinton appointees in 36.5 percent.

Yet crime continues to have considerable political resonance. In the name of fighting crime, Mr. Clinton has expanded the Federal death penalty to cover 50 offenses. The bill limited the power of Federal courts to review state court proceedings for all crimes, not just for terrorism-related offenses. The law was an unconstitutional effort to censor speech, said a three-judge Federal panel that recently ruled against it. The Clinton Administration is appealing that decision to the Supreme Court."
"Food and Drug Administration approves vaccine to prevent whooping cough in infants that is less likely than current vaccine to cause fever, irritability and other side effects (S) ","The vaccine used until now for infants contained whole, killed cells of the bacterium that causes the disease. Pertussis vaccine is one component of the familiar'' DTP'' series given to children to prevent whooping cough as well as diphtheria and tetanus. Because Tripedia is also combined with the other two vaccines, researchers said, children who began their injections with the whole-cell vaccine can and should be switched to Tripedia. But the older vaccine is also mixed with a meningitis vaccine. The effectiveness of the old and new pertussis vaccines is comparable, researchers said. Tripedia costs pediatricians about $ 17 per dose as against $ 10 per dose for the older vaccine."

This election-year conversion is welcome news to those of us who have been leading the fight to reform our failed welfare system.

But Christine Roth, a lawyer, said at least two Bavarian doctors planned to seek a Constitutional Court ruling because doctors acting legally in the performance of abortions under federal law could be jailed for one year under Bavarian law. The opposition Social Democratic Party said it would support the doctors' action.

Most of the evidence has pointed to the other men, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef and Abdul Hakim Murad, who prosecutors say used Manila as the base to prepare for attacks on a dozen jetliners early last year. The computer, which prosecutors say contained details of a plan to blow up American jetliners, was found on Jan. 7, 1995, in a apartment where the Philippine police say Mr. Yousef and Mr. Murad were mixing explosives."
Editorial scores Pres Clinton's decision to sign welfare-reform bill; says he exaggerates its tiny virtues and ignores some large faults; says bill that creates child poverty is not acceptable way to end welfare as we know it (M) ,President Clinton's defense at yesterday's press conference of his decision to sign an atrocious welfare bill exaggerated its tiny virtues and ignored some large faults. His disappointing excuse was that the flawed bill was the last realistic chance to fulfill his campaign promise to'' end welfare as we know it.'' This conservative Congress longs to send him as many bills as it takes to cut welfare. The President said the bill would replace welfare checks with paychecks. The bill says it would require states to put at least 50 percent of welfare parents to work within two years of going on welfare. It is not fair to cut parents off welfare unless they are provided an opportunity to work. A bill that creates child poverty is not an acceptable way to end welfare as we know it.
"Editorial says explosive outburst of politrical violence in Indonesia could signal serious challenge to 30-year rule of Pres Suharto, which must now choose between its own pertepuation in power and orderly political transition; says US must use considerable influence to discourage reflexive repression and encourage timelychange (M) ","Indonesia's long-suppressed political life erupted into violence in Jakarta last weekend. This explosive outburst could signal a serious challenge to the 30-year-long rule of Indonesia's leader, Suharto. The country's suppressed opposition forces can mount no more than a modest political challenge to the military-backed regime at this point. General Suharto's extended rule has brought order and economic progress at the expense of most political freedoms. Indonesians have also become impatient with a closed political system that for years allowed only two tame opposition parties. It also blames the rioting on Indonesia's no-longer-significant Communist Party, reviving memories of the regime's earliest days. The Suharto regime must now choose between its own perpetuation in power and an orderly political transition."

Editorial urges US Sen Alfonse D'Amato to spearhead drive in Senate's to secure funds to save Sterling Forest from developers (M) ,"Sterling Forest, a vital watershed straddling the New York-New Jersey border, may soon be liberated from Congressional bondage. The bill already has strong Democratic support. Lying 40 miles northwest of New York City, Sterling Forest consists of 20,000 acres of lakes and woodlands. In legislative terms, Sterling Forest has suffered long enough. Late last year, for example, the forest purchase was attached to a bill that would have forced an offsetting sale of some 55,000 acres of Federal grasslands in Oklahoma. Most recently, Sterling Forest got tangled up in a parks bill that included a provision weakening environmental protections on Federal grazing land. Now, as he promised six months ago, House Speaker Newt Gingrich has delivered to the Senate a relatively clean Sterling Forest bill unencumbered with harmful precedents for national environmental policy."

Government can not replace parental guidance but it can reinforce it in several ways. That means teaching children premarital abstinence. Government must encourage abstinence among young people, and contraception among adults unwilling or unable to accept the responsibility of parenthood.

For children who lack the love and guidance of a responsible parent, government should promote adoption or encourage the influence of an adult mentor."

Suddenly, Pack could n't cut to the basket or pull off his trademark stunt: the ability to dunk over big men, almost unheard of for a 6-foot-2-inch point guard.

Text of Pres Clinton's remarks at news conference on decision to sign welfare-reform legislation (L) ,"But on balance, this bill is a real step forward for our country, our values, and for people who are on welfare. First and foremost, it should be about moving people from welfare to work. It should give people the child care and the health care they need to move from welfare to work without hurting their children. You can not ask somebody on welfare to go to work if they're going to neglect their children in doing it. And it preserves the national guarantee of health care for poor children, the disabled, pregnant women, the elderly and people on welfare. If every parent paid the child support they should, we could move 800,000 women and children off welfare immediately. We could n't get the extra child care. THE WELFARE BILL"

The idea that it is better to substitute frequent, very light waterings during high summer because it cools the plant is slightly misunderstood. Keep your lawn at the right summer height ( 2 to 2.5 inches for Kentucky blue, perennial rye and fine fescue grasses; 3 to 3.5 for tall fescues ) and the leaves will provide their own cooling shade for the base of the plant. Plants use the blue part of the light spectrum, and a tiny bit of the neighboring ultraviolet, to regulate their enzyme and respiratory processes and encourage compact growth with dark green leaves. Red light stimulates stem and leaf growth. Bronze blocks blue light and green blocks both blue and red."

"Erik Linden letter comments on July 26 article on urban decay in Washington, DC (S) ","To the Editor: I grew up in Ward 3, the'' affluent'' part of Washington ( front page, July 26 ) and went to college there. Two years ago I moved to San Francisco. Home for a visit, I was shocked at the decay: the slashed services, the potholes and the circus-like government of Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. Living in San Francisco has shown me how cities are supposed to function. The problems plaguing the city are worsened by a dysfunctional government. What is called for is a removal of that government by the Federal Government. The financial control board established by Congress is a step in the right direction.

Richard W Metz letter disputes Lawrence Krauss July 29 Op-Ed article on hesitancy among journalists to question scientific views that are tantamount to nonsense (M) ,"Op-Ed, July 29 ) would doubtless agree that his article does not in fact demonstrate, or try to demonstrate, that creationist views are false. The fact that a position is labeled'' creationist'' fails, on any conceivable basis, to prove it wrong. Science studies the natural. If there is any fact or truth beyond nature, science knows nothing about it and has nothing to say on the subject. To introduce bad science into a course on science is a bad thing. To allow students to understand that some people believe there is truth with which science is not concerned is intellectually defensible."
Steven Weber letter disputes Lawrence M Krauss's July 29 Op-Ed article on truth in science (S) ,"To the Editor: Lawrence Krauss ( Op-Ed, July 29 ) does a disservice to the public and to the scientific community to argue that'' a theory whose predictions fail the test of experiment is always wrong, period.'' Social scientists are familiar with debates that ensue when a theory fails to predict accurately. Do we junk the theory after a single prediction failure? But it may also be that we did not derive the predictions accurately from the theory. Or the experiment was poorly constructed, so that it was not a definitive test. Physicists are better than social scientists at making sure that predictions do derive directly from the theories they test. But few physicists I know would discard a theory for prediction failure without thinking through a number of reasons the prediction failed."
J D Wetterling letter lauds Lawrence M Krauss's July 29 Op-Ed article on truth in science (S) ,"Op-Ed, July 29 ) for pulling off the same scam that Alan Sokal pulled on the editors of Social Text when they published his send-up of science criticism. Professor Krauss's argument for a closed mind, clothed in the academic raiment of a pompous pagan, is social satire at its finest. His case for evolution versus creationism by a sovereign God using the DNA argument is the ultimate irony. What we know of DNA so far suggests merely a blueprint for life. Yet, what I see in the mirror every morning when I shave is prima facie evidence for Darwin's theory of evolution. Perhaps that is an empirically falsifiable presupposition, or maybe my brains have just fallen into the sink. J. D. WETTERLINGOldsmar, Fla., July 30, 1996Don't"

"Holland Cotter reviews exhibitions of furniture at Parrish Art Museum, South Hampton, one of Shaker objects, the other designs of Donald Judd; photos (M) ","A Shaker chair, spare and elegant, will give instant and familiar visual pleasure to the eye schooled in modernist design. The 86 pieces in'' Shaker: Just as Shaker design eventually gave in to a prevailing late Victorian esthetic of heaviness and accumulation, 20th-century modernist art and design might be seen as a slow but persistent re-establishment of a visual ideal of clarity and simplicity. Judd did n't call upon Shaker work as a point of reference for his own art. And then there is the question of art itself. For Shakers, art implied separating form from function, a frivolous, even spiritually hazardous endeavor. And yet, important connections between the Shaker craftsmen and modernist artists like Judd run deep."

And suddenly the audience was treated to the pleasures of concert band music as it was during its glory days, when ensembles led by the marchmeister John Philip Sousa, Arthur Pryor ( billed the'' Paganini of the Trombone'' ) and others toured America's parks and town squares. The concert band is the ideal outdoor ensemble.

Bernard Holland reviews operas-in-concert of Beethoven's Lenonore and Fidelio peformed by Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique and Monteverdi Choir at Lincoln Center Festival '96; photo ,"Tuesday listeners entering Avery Fisher Hall on Wednesday were blinded by the stage's sea of crisp, white dinner jackets, quite a jolt after Mr. Gardiner's dark shirts and drama-enhancing scruffiness. Beethoven's opera, whatever the version, struggles to bind together real people with the louder demands of European politics. Here they are ennobled in Beethoven's canonic quartet, in which characters declare their crossed purposes and create one of opera's enduring moments. These were different casts for different places. Mighty overtures surround these operas. Yet for all their wonderful moments, both'' Leonore'' and'' Fidelio'' give off a certain helplessness, like problem children a bit beyond parental control.

Even without the Velazquez and the busts by Bernini and Algardi, this would be an exceptional occasion, but the three portraits of Innocent are the main attraction, a show within the show. Innocent was famously ugly, with tiny eyes, big ears, a bulbous nose and a sparse beard. Algardi's portrait is actually more affecting. Like Bernini and Algardi, Velazquez gives Innocent's features a kind of make-over:"

The Jewish heritage is inside and outside the Western mainstream. The very term'' Old Testament'' indicates this position.

Citing its nightly surveys of viewer satisfaction, NBC says the public does not care whether events are live or taped. But what NBC does not ask in its surveys is whether viewers would like to be given a context-- to know what was unfolding as they watched and which events actually took place earlier. American networks broadcasting to American viewers are always going to focus on American athletes. There will always be attempts to personalize the competitors with feature stories that emphasize family tragedies, childhood physical ailments and heartbreaking disappointments. This year's broadcasts, in their absolute deference to conveniently interpreted viewer preference, are in deep denial of that fact."

Providing better security requires not just relocation, but improved coordination between American and Saudi officials involved in tracking potential terrorists.

The Giants tried to hire him, but he decided to make a risky move and coach the Jaguars. I ca n't look back.''After only one season Coughlin has earned a great deal of respect from his coaching peers and others around the National Football League.

Andrei Shumilin of Russia defeats Bruce Baumgartner of US in superheavyweight wrestling match at Atlanta Olympics; photo (M) ,"The dream came tumbling down today for Bruce Baumgartner. Shumilin won the bronze medal in the 1993 world championships ( Baumgartner won the gold ), and the 26-year-old Russian seemed quicker here. The loss relegated Baumgartner to the losers' bracket, and in two hours he would have to wrestle there. His world championship portfolio since 1983 shows three gold, three silver and three bronze medals. With the match barely a minute old, Shumilin had an underhook on Baumgartner and Baumgartner had an overhook on him. For a split second, that left Baumgartner off-balance. Shumilin seized the moment and tipped Baumgartner on his back. When the match ended, the crowd gave Baumgartner a standing ovation."

Federal authorities say 10 current and former employees of two businesses that transfer money have been charged with laundering up to $1.3 million in illegal drug profits; identify companies as Ramesas America Oriental Inc in Bronx and Dinero Express in upper Manhattan (S) ,"The laundering technique, called restructuring, involves splitting up large sums of cash into smaller quantities before transferring them overseas. Such transfers do not have to be reported to the Government, because they are below a $ 10,000 ceiling. In the investigation, undercover agents for the Customs and Internal Revenue Services, posing as drug dealers, gave the businesses large sums of cash and left it to them to move the money without reporting the transfers. To deter laundering, the Government requires that a report of any cash transaction of $ 10,000 or more has to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service using a form called a Currency Transaction Report. Such companies tend to cater to immigrants without bank accounts who want to send cash to relatives."

We agree that there is no reliable single test. Nonetheless, the dementia that is the hallmark of the disease can be reliably assessed through a battery of neuropsychological tests. Such tests reveal patterns of cognitive impairment characteristic of Alzheimer's and are sensitive enough to detect the disease in its earliest stages. A diagnosis may be made when a person's memory functioning is consistently impaired, along with demonstrated deficits in at least one of these areas: ability to learn new information even with repetition, verbal identification of objects, visual analysis and part-whole reasoning. Neuropsychological tests allow for analysis of each patient's strengths and weaknesses, helping to predict the course the illness will take."

"Neil Strauss reviews concerts by two former members of Minneapolis band Replacements, which broke up in 1990; Paul Westerberg performed at Irving Plaza, and Tommy Stinson performed at Mercury Lounge; photo (M) ","The Replacements entered the 1980's ripping and roaring, becoming the smartest, brashest, loudest pop-punk band ever to perform songs by Kiss, Cher and Black Sabbath. On Wednesday night, in the second of two shows at Irving Plaza, Paul Westerberg extended the more polished sound of later Replacements albums, which makes sense, since in its final albums the Replacements had changed from a democracy into a monarchy with Mr. Westerberg wearing the crown. Tommy, who is 29, joined the band as its bassist when he was only 12.Part of the appeal of the Replacements' later albums and Mr. Westerberg's two solo albums is the expressive range and poetic insight he can convey on almost any subject within the confines of a three- or four-minute verse-chorus-verse pop song.''"

But before recessing last night until after Labor Day, Congress passed two worthy bills while some malicious ones stalled. Congress sent the White House a bill to protect workers' health coverage when they move from job to job, which will be, pathetically, the only real health care reform to come out of President Clinton's four years in office. Another election-driven, easily misunderstood bill would require the Federal Government to conduct official business only in English. Although the House has approved the English language bill, the confused stampede toward summer recess postponed a final vote on that measure or the equally mean-spirited immigration bill until Congress returns in the fall."

During the party convention in Ankara, an unidentified man wearing a burnoose cut down the Turkish flag and raised the flag of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., the Kurdish guerrilla group outlawed by the Government. The flag substitution set off a furor around the country as Turkish television repeatedly replayed the incident.

Mr. Clinton repudiated his own spokesman's promise that he would sign the bill and asked why one person should benefit when his own staff had incurred steep legal bills.

"Export growth for many countries in East Asian region--including original 'Four Tigers' of Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, as well as half-dozen other countries that are following the same fast-growth path--has slowed sharply this year; and China's exports have actually declined; deceleration in part reflects healthy cooling off of economies that were running risk of overheating; but it also raises questions about staying power of East Asia's export-driven economic boom; in particular, it translates into deterioration of region's trade balance; that, in turn, threatens to drag area's currencies lower against the dollar and the yen, a development that could lead to unpredictable economic consequences; graph (L) ","But in May, the International Monetary Fund said it expected Asia's growth rate to slow only'' slightly'' in 1996 to'' about 8 percent,'' compared with 8.4 percent last year, as a result of tighter financial policies in a number of countries. As a result of the more restrictive credit policies and slowing economic growth, the I.M.F. also predicted a reduction in East Asia's overall inflation rate to 8.4 percent this year from 10.9 percent in 1995Part of the export slowdown is a statistical sleight-of-hand. The dollar's weakness and the yen's strength in the early months of 1995 tended to exaggerate these countries' export growth measured in dollars, just as this year's stronger dollar and weaker yen exaggerated the slowdown."

"Study by Princeton University labor economist Alan B Krueger has found remarkably consistent correlation between interest rate on 30-year Treasury bond and job creation; more specifically, Krueger formula focuses on spread between what Wall Street's forecasters say the new jobs number will be, and what number actually is in Labor Department's announcement on first Friday morning of each month (L) ","So it is not surprising that a formula has appeared for predicting how much interest rates will move in response to the job numbers.

Between jobs and wages, the 30-year bond rate should have moved up by 8 basis points, or nearly one-tenth of a percent. Wall Street and the Labor Department were almost in agreement on the job number for July: 200,000 for the forecasters and 193,000 for the Labor Department, too small a difference to move the bond rate.

"Jack Anderson comments on challenges facing choreographers who seek to depict immaterial spirits, like ghosts and fairies, or generalized qualities, like allegorical incarnations of sadness or anger itself; photo (M) ","TALENTED choreographers can get away with the oddest things. Even the airiest dancer is made of solid flesh. All reveal how ingenuity can prevent choreographers from tripping up on what could be an esthetic obstacle course. The obstacle-course image was used back in 1949 by the dance writer Edwin Denby in his book'' Looking at the Dance.'' Other choreographers, Denby thought, filled works with such obstacles. In 1962 he had dancers mimic supernatural beings in'' A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' the evening-length work that closed the New York City Ballet's recent season at the New York State Theater. Audiences at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., witnessed vivid glimpses of hell when the Los Angeles-based American Repertory Dance Company presented a program of solos by prominent choreographers.

"Lawrence B Johnson reviews two new classical CD's issued by Delos; notes Delos's new 'virtual reality' recordings employ different recording technique, called discrete surround; all five channels are recorded independently and reproduced that way when digital stream is passed through special decoder; photo of conductor Zdenek Macal (M) ","And that has-- again, generally-- meant Dolby Surround, which is a method of encoding four channels of sound ( left, center, right and monophonic rear ) into the two channels of conventional stereo.

To make them playable now, the Tchaikovsky and the Gliere have been mixed down to conventional Dolby Surround, encoded in two-channel stereo.

When normal stereo was restored, the sound field collapsed to a shadow of the surround image."
James R Oestreich on healing power of music such as Beethoven's Egmont Overture to counter evil such as terrorist actions at Munich Olympics in 1972 and recent bombing at Atlanta Olympics (M) ,"At least one listener was carried back musically as well, and set to pondering the nature of musical homage and musical meaning. On the evening of the calamity in Atlanta, a sold-out throng of concertgoers diverted themselves, not unreasonably, with a Beethoven concert in the Venetian Theater at the Caramoor International Music Festival, in Katonah, N.Y. Does n't a cumulation of concrete extramusical associations overburden a piece and crowd out musical meaning? If we had any precise idea what musical meaning consisted of, an answer might be possible. But clearly, such associations form part of the meaning music holds for us. FOR ME, THE NOTION OF MUSICAL MEANING was permanently broadened one Easter morning some dozen years ago. Let the Games end, peacefully, and live on in music."
