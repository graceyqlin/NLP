"Clyde Haberman column notes 25th anniversary of inmate uprising at Attica State Prison in upstate New York and subsequent quelling of riots by state police; discusses lessons that have been learned, or should have been learned, in regard to conditions that led to riot (M) ","On Sept. 13 of that year, state police officers under the ultimate command of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller stormed the maximum-security prison to end the takeover of a cell block yard by inmates who had held several dozen guards hostage for four days. Partly to recall how events can spin out of control, a helpful lesson when prisons are a leading growth industry in New York State. IN 1971, the state's prison population was 12,500. Some convicts are double-bunked, as they also are at other institutions, a situation that inmate advocates and prison guards alike warn could aggravate frictions. After the 1971 uprising, conditions in state prisons improved, but recent backsliding is hard to ignore."

In January, several Republicans, contended that Mr. Rubin should be impeached for thwarting the will of Congress. In the spring, quietly, they raised the debt ceiling to $ 5.5 trillion. To stay within the $ 4.9 trillion limit, the Treasury redeemed $ 46 billion in Treasury securities held by the Civil Service trust fund and converted them to cash. The Treasury also suspended the investing of billions more of retirement funds in Treasury bonds, and performed similar accounting tricks with two other funds."

"Critics assail system unique to New Jersey in which small group of accountants controls annual audits of all of state's towns and counties, using arcane rules laid out in books and loose-leaf notebooks stored in their offices and passed on to a select few; say audit reports, for which many municipalities pay fees twice those by cities of similar size in nearby states, give so little useful information that taxpayers, and even local officials, have little hope of learning how towns spend money; accountants have quashed legislative efforts for major change, but as towns come under pressure to account for use of taxpayer funds because of reductions in state aid, increasing number of state officials say they want accounting rules changed to those used in 33 other states (M) ","It is a system unique to New Jersey. Some New Jersey municipalities are paying audit fees twice those paid by cities of similar size in nearby states.

Sheldon V Turner letter disputes Anthony Lewis's Sept 6 Op-Ed column deploring hatred directed at Federal Government (S) ,"To the Editor: While Anthony Lewis ( column, Sept. 6 ) correctly discerns the voter animus toward government, he does not put this rage in historical perspective. This lack of confidence toward the occasionally patrician hand of government is in no way, however, a denunciation of the overall role of government in our lives.''Big government'' has given us the New Deal, the Great Society and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It has also given us voracious entitlements programs, an ineffective welfare system and costly regulations that have burdened business owners for half a century. In doing so, he transfers responsibility from a bipartisan government to a partisan scapegoat. It makes one more understanding of Americans' hatred of the news media than of their hatred for government."

He attributes some of the hostility to the Vietnam War and Watergate. But the people venting anger on talk radio probably wanted to nuke North Vietnam. And they're probably angry at President Reagan for firing Oliver North, not for subverting the Constitution.

She said the Government would aim for a final design incorporating the best aspects of the submissions. An honorable mention went to the Madrid architects Alberto Martinez and Beatriz Matos. The other honorable mention went to the Zurich architect Jean-Pierre Durig. His $ 105 million proposal envisions a new building extending about three blocks parallel to and behind the Prado.

Doctors prescribe at least 10 forms of calcium channel blockers to treat high blood pressure, chest pain from angina and other ailments.

They said that uncertainties about the choice of drugs should not interfere with efforts to control high blood pressure, which if untreated could lead to complications like strokes and heart attacks. The studies suggest that such drugs may cause an increased incidence of fatal heart attack, bleeding from the stomach and intestinal tract and cancer. Yet calcium channel blocker drugs have been marketed for two decades. Both drugs offered similar benefit in lowering blood pressure."

The medication is subject to the monitoring and regulations of Federal and state governments and can be given only in methadone treatment clinics.

Carrie K Monahan letter disputes John Cronin's Sept 7 Op-Ed article on threat to fish from hyrdoelectric plants (M) ,"To the Editor: Fish versus the electric company. That's the choice posed by John Cronin ( Op-Ed, Sept. 7 ), who frames the debate as the environmentalists versus the big, greedy power companies. That makes for a good headline--'' The Cost of Electricity Per Species''-- but not necessarily good public policy. While Mr. Cronin is mainly concerned about power plants that use water for cooling, the narrow fish-versus-electricity debate also clouds the future of America's hydroelectric plants. Hydroelectricity, a clean, abundant, renewable resource, represents 10 percent of our nation's power generation. Fish are an issue with hydro plants, too. In the relicensing process, these stakeholders need to have their voices heard to insure a balanced policy for operating hydro facilities."

"Felix Rohatyn Op-Ed article argues in favor of 4.3-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline tax, which was included in Pres Clinton's 1993 budget, but which has come under attack; says repealing it would be bad energy policy and bad economic policy; says such funds could be available to state and local governments for public investment, and could be used especially for rebuilding cities; drawing (M) ","A decade ago, in response to the abysmal state of New York City's public school buildings, the Municipal Assistance Corporation, with the support of Mayor Edward I. Koch and Gov. Mario Cuomo, committed $ 400 million of its surplus funds to creating a new School Construction Authority. Such problems are not limited to New York City or to schools. With its share, New York State could generate $ 5 billion to $ 7 billion over the period. Each state would decide how best to use the money, but a significant portion would be committed to new schools and education technology. A program that would give city and state governments $ 75 billion to $ 100 billion would provide only a fraction of the more than $ 2 trillion needed nationwide for public improvements."
Richard Bernstein reviews John Evangelist Walsh book Unraveling Piltdown: The Science Fraud of the Century and its Solution; photo (M) ,"UNRAVELING PILTDOWN this scientific detective story, John Evangelist Walsh claims to solve once and for all the mystery of the Piltdown fraud, deducing from the evidence the identity of the man who perpetrated it and explaining how he managed to keep some of the best minds in England fooled for 40 years. This had the practical effect of sowing confusion in the study of human evolution for decades, since Piltdown man with his big brain but ape face was entirely inconsistent with all other fossil evidence. Walsh's unmasking of Dawson goes well beyond these elements of circumstantial evidence, however. In the meantime, Mr. Walsh's fine book is an occasion for reflection on the human propensity for deceit and self-deception, of which Piltdown man is far from the only example."
"Editorial says agreement to clean up 2,000-square-mile watershed that supplies New York City with drinking water is triumph of good sense over seemingly insurmountable grievances, and will spare city need to build $6 billion filtration plant it can ill afford (M) ","The formal agreement announced yesterday to clean up the 2,000-square-mile watershed that supplies New York City with its drinking water is a triumph of good sense over seemingly insurmountable grievances. New York City has long had the power to regulate development around its 19 upstate reservoirs. Commercial development proceeded rapidly, water quality declined, and in 1989 the Federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered the city to clean up the watershed or build a filtration plant. The agreement, which will be administered by essentially the same coalition of forces, is not wholly satisfactory to some environmentalists, who complain that it allows for too many new sewage treatment plants, thus inviting harmful new development. New Yorkers will continue to receive inexpensive, high-quality drinking water."
"Editorial accuses Pres Clinton of having transparent political motives in announcing plans to appoint commission to examine how well modern health-care plans treat patients, but that commission is, nevertheless, constructive idea (S) ","President Clinton had a transparent political motive in announcing that he would appoint a commission to examine how well modern health-care plans treat patients. The spread of health maintenance organizations, which now cover more than 60 million Americans, has slowed the increase in health-care costs. But the growth of the managed-care approach has created anxiety about whether patients are being denied treatments in order to lower the costs of health-care companies. Equally important, it can help educate citizens about changes in the health-care system already made or needed in the future. It could also prod all health plans, whether traditional or managed-care, to assume the responsibility of collecting easy-to-compare data on their treatment practices and health outcomes. But if he appoints the commission judiciously, it could help renew the chances of building an effective and economical health-care system."
Editorial worries that too much remains unclear about transfer of power by Russian Pres Boris Yeltsin as he prepares to undergo heart surgery; says Yeltsin and aides should settle on more comprehensive plan that is free of ambiguities (S) ,"He announced last week that he needs heart surgery and plans an operation later this month. Yeltsin has temporarily placed most national security and law enforcement authority under the direct control of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. That leaves a troubling degree of ambiguity over precisely how much presidential power will be transferred and for how long. But there are no formal guidelines or mechanisms for determining when a president is sufficiently infirm to warrant a transfer of power. Though Mr. Yeltsin and his doctors have not specified the nature of his heart ailment or the type of operation he will have, the most likely procedure is bypass surgery. Yeltsin and his aides should settle on a clearer, more comprehensive plan for transferring power in advance of the surgery. Mr. Yeltsin and his Government owe Russians no less than an orderly transfer."
Editorial scores failure of House Ethics Committee for allowing Congress to adjourn without resolving any of pending ethics complaints against House Speaker Newt Gingrich (S) ,"The committee's present plans do not even call for making public the lengthy report filed last month by James Cole, the special counsel belatedly hired by the committee to look into tax law charges against the Speaker. They gave him a limited mandate to examine whether Mr. Gingrich had violated tax laws by using tax-deductible donations to finance a college course he taught in Georgia in 1993. It is not known whether the evidence gathered by Mr. Cole exonerates the Speaker on the tax charges, or suggests he behaved either improperly or unethically. But the issue at this point is not just Mr. Gingrich's conduct, or the thoroughness of Mr. Cole's work, but the efficacy of the committee itself."

So the California trial may be delayed until after Mrs. McDougal finishes serving time for contempt. But W. Ray Jahn, an associate Whitewater prosecutor, has asked Federal Judge Susan Webber Wright not to subtract the time Mrs. McDougal serves on the contempt charge from her prison sentence because that would make the contempt citation meaningless. Mrs. McDougal faces a maximum sentence of seven years on those counts, which include grand theft, forgery and credit card fraud. After Mrs. McDougal said that some money she took represented legitimate compensation, she was charged with state income-tax evasion."

"Excerpt from 1990 article by Pat Choate, Reform Party Vice Presidential candidate, in Harvard Business Review (S) ","Following is an excerpt from a 1990 article by Pat Choate in the Harvard Business Review. It plays the American economic game by American rules. It uses the campaign tactics and methods of American politics. It hires Americans to lobby, educate and influence other Americans. It is also deeply corrosive of the U.S. political and economic system. The value of national service-- for an individual to be of service to the country and to work on behalf of the country's interest-- has been cheapened by a more mundane coin of the realm: personal advancement, self-interest, big money. As a consequence, the United States is not only selling corporate assets and real estate to foreign bidders; also for sale is U.S. integrity and national honor."

Stephen H Miller comments on Sept 8 article on campaign by transsexuals for respect (S) ,"To the Editor: Your Sept. 8 report about'' transgendered'' people's fight for respect indicates some friction within gay and lesbian groups.

A male-to-female transsexual is legally a woman and can marry a man. Neither the Federal Government nor the states have any problem with this-- a departure from the prevailing attitude about same-sex matrimony.

If we say gay men and lesbians are the same as people who suffer from'' gender identity dysphoria,'' we will reinforce the myth that homosexuals are unhappy and that we wish to change.

Moreover, although the best managed care has provided useful tools for physicians to coordinate and assess the care they deliver, the research that can reduce inappropriate care remains in its infancy.

"Neil Strauss reviews performance by music group The Cranberries at PNC Bank ARts Center, Holmdel, NJ; photo (M) ","The result is an album best summarized by the title of an earlier Cranberries song,'' Ridiculous Thoughts.''Nonetheless, the Cranberries have become one of the most popular Irish acts in America, using the instrumentation of a rock band to make lush, billowing folk-music abstractions topped by the silvery vocals of Dolores O'Riordan. Perhaps the Cranberries should take a tip from the Cocteau Twins, whose ethereal guitar swirl clearly influenced their music, and sing nonsense words. To her credit, Ms. O'Riordan can sing almost anything and make it seem musical, and she did this in concert, adding yodels, yips and all kinds of extraneous flourishes to the songs while prancing around the stage."

Evidence of African design's new-found popularity can be found in the breadth of its appeal. In'' The Spirit of African Design'' ( Clarkson N. Potter, 1996 ), the designers Sharne Algotsson and Denys Davis maintain that Africa is one of the world's richest sources of design-- stylistically and emotionally. Davis added that African design, often laden with sophisticated symbolism, can be both complex and simple in its line and application of color. In Ms. Inis's Harlem apartment, she combines her collection of African musical instruments with a baby grand piano. Some designs that are often believed to be strictly American or European-- Art Deco and Empire, for example-- have African touchstones, Ms. Davis said."

"New York City Council approves bill that will allow police to arrest squeegee men, beggars at automatic teller machines and other aggressive panhandlers (M) ","The New York City Council approved a bill yesterday that would allow the police to arrest squeegee men, beggars at automatic teller machines and other aggressive panhandlers. Several of the opponents were black Council members who voiced a deep suspicion of the Police Department. They said the city was giving police officers too much authority to crack down on panhandlers, insisting that the bill would criminalize such a wide swath of behavior that it would lead to abuses. The bill, which was modeled after similar measures in other cities, reflects a growing movement across the country to restrict the conduct of panhandlers. Some black members said the city needed to rein in the Police Department, not give it more ways of arresting people."

Editorial says Ross Perot's choice of Pat Choate as Vice Presidential running mate does little to increase his meager Presidential prospects (M) ,"Ross Perot's choice of Pat Choate as his running mate does little to increase his meager Presidential prospects. But'' President Choate''? These issues are, first, the threat to American jobs from multinational corporations and America's trading partners, and second, the destructive influence of big money in Washington. Like Mr. Perot, Dr. Choate is eager to confront President Clinton and Bob Dole for their reluctance to address Washington's money-driven political culture-- the influence of lobbyists and big campaign contributors. In 1990 Dr. Choate combined these two interests in a controversial book,'' Agents of Influence,'' an attack on foreign attempts to manipulate American policy.

I prefer to live in the world that we have grown used to, where rules and norms prevent knee-jerk violent responses by powerful states and where even the United States feels compelled to justify its actions to the international community. DEBORAH AVANTWashington, Sept. 8, 1996The writer is an assistant professor of political science at George Washington University."
David B Simpson letter comments on Sept 5 article US-Iraqi tensions (S) ,"In a time when we remain the sole superpower, resort to such weaponry has the superficial allure of seeming to allow us to strike at enemies with minimal danger to our soldiers in the field, and therefore of presenting little political risk to the leaders who would send them into battle. American arms should be used only where there exists grave and imminent risk to the identifiable American interests of the most pressing kind. Moreover, pursuit of such an imperial policy vastly increases the prospect that retaliation by the nations or groups we attack will inflict on our citizens the kind of internal terrorism that afflicts so much of the world."

Increases in security, identification checks, added costs and burdens upon us will not deter attacks but envelop us in fear. Those who commit these atrocities should endure the heaviest toll we can place upon them. Every effort must be expended by our leaders to punish the parties that bear responsibility.

Indeed, for which threat should the airlines spend to safeguard against-- bombs, missiles, accidents or mechanical failure? Imagine what it would cost to build detection and evasion systems into commercial aircraft and tie them into the local missile defense system. Let's not burden the airline companies with the cost of defense systems that may not be required to meet the threat."
"New York Yankees defeat Detroit Tigers, 7-3; photo (M) ","The chronically unhappy Ruben Sierra desperately wanted to help the Yankees advance to the post-season, but they traded him to the Tigers in July. Sierra might have achieved his wish tonight anyway. Sierra's error helped the Yankees shatter a 3- 3 tie and steal a 7- 3 victory from Detroit. Although Manager Joe Torre and his players refused to snicker about the irony of Sierra's misfortune, it was impossible not to ask them how it felt to have Sierra win a game for the Yankees. While the Yankees lost a potential two-run single, they instantly received a break when the plate umpire, Joe Brinkman, called an obvious 3- 0 strike to Cecil Fielder ball four to force in the tie-breaking and second run."

"Jerry Jones, owner of Dallas Cowboys, says his decision not to extend Coach Barry Switzer's contract, as he has done last two years, is strictly good business (S) ","JERRY JONES, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, said his decision not to extend Coach BARRY SWITZER's contract, as he has done the last two years, is strictly good business. When he hired Switzer in 1994, Jones gave him a five-year contract with a rollover option, meaning it could continue to be a five-year deal as long as the National Football League team wanted. Jones invoked the rollover before the 1994 playoff opener to relieve pressure on the rookie coach. It just is not necessary for any constituency to bolster the confidence by rolling over the contract, and it would not be good business for the team,'' Jones told The Dallas Morning News yesterday. Jones said Switzer still could be around longer.''"

He argues that these listings threaten America's sovereignty over its territory and interfere with state authority over state land. Young's position displays a fundamental misconception of the World Heritage Convention, which was adopted in 1972 on the initiative of President Nixon. The World Heritage Convention provides a process by which governments nominate sites within their own territories for listing. What Mr. Young really does not like is that management of heritage sites can come under an international spotlight when serious threats arise. 1996The writer was chairman of the World Wildlife Fund from 1985- 94."

"Holland Cotter reviews paintings by Yeong Gill Kim, at Art Projects International (S) ","Yeong Gill Kim The canvas surfaces are scuffed and stained, setting up smudgy, accidental landscapes, with mountains defined here and there by clusters of curved lines. The dominant forms, though, are crowds of tiny human figures swarming out to the paintings' edges. By thinning his pigment down to the gray, soaked-in consistency of ink on absorbent paper, Mr. Kim makes clear references to a long, contemplative tradition of Asian brush painting. Previously this artist has collaged photographic images from recent history-- the Japanese occupation of Korea, the Korean War-- into his work. The results are n't earth-shattering, but they suggest one of the many ways, on the conservative end of the spectrum in this case, that contemporary Asian artists are drawing ideas from a blend of Western and non-Western traditions."

"Michael Kimmelman reviews works by Giorgio de Chirico, at Hunter College gallery; photos (S) ","IS there a stranger case among the great artists of the 20th century than Giorgio de Chirico? De Chirico seemed hellbent on self-immolation. The works are from American collections, or were in earlier American shows of de Chirico, or were made by de Chirico while he was in America during the 1930's, or are fantasies of Manhattan skyscrapers that he drew or painted as early as 1918 or as late as the 1970's. One way to look at de Chirico's later copies of his early pictures is to see them as revenge against the Surrealists: he devalued the early art by suggesting that there was nothing special, or irreproducible, about it. A show of de Chirico's works from 1920 to 1970 at the Robert Miller Gallery in Manhattan in 1984 signaled the revaluation."

Ms. Paige, who had been starring in the show in London's West End, has yet to reach the integrated characterization provided by Ms. Close's psychopathic Norma or by Ms. Buckley's Norma as neurasthenic.

"Scientists report that hormone recently discovered in brains of humans and rats acts as powerful appetite suppressant in rodents; researchers think the hormone, urocortin, may be what causes people and animals to lose their appetites when they are under stress or in danger; urocortin is third brain hormone reported within last 15 months to suppress appetite (M) ","A hormone recently discovered in the brains of both humans and rats acts as a powerful appetite suppressant in the rodents, scientists are reporting today. Urocortin is the third brain hormone reported within the last 15 months to suppress appetite.

Dr. Vale recalled that when he and his colleagues studied the distribution of urocortin in the brain,'' we said, this screams' appetite.''' Urocortin proved 30 times more effective than C.R.F. at suppressing appetite, Dr. Vale said. That led the researchers to wonder whether drugs that acted like urocortin or altered its levels might quell a person's appetite without causing side effects."

"Editorial says Pres Clinton, who promised to put the poor to work, signed welfare bill that will do little more than punish them and imperil their children, because they are broke; claims principled resignations of three high officials in his own administration say time for Clinton to protect poor children expired when he signed that bill ","Wendell Primus, a Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, resigned last month because he could not serve an Administration that had approved a welfare bill that, by his own calculations, would throw more than a million children into poverty. Each resigned as a principled response to President Clinton's decision to sign an awful welfare bill. Like the Republicans, he called for time limits on welfare benefits. Clinton's original proposal recognized that about $ 10 billion more would have to be spent on training and putting welfare recipients to work. But their quiet, principled acts cast a dark shadow on the White House's promise to soften the welfare law's harsh edges through legislative and administrative remedies."

Under the tutelage of the United Nations, President Cristiani signed a peace agreement with the leftist guerrillas in 1992. The new interim party leader has stronger ties to Arena's right wing. Washington, for its part, should condemn terror methods and violations of the peace accords."

They brought the bill up while the Senate was getting ready to vote by an overwhelming margin to deny Federal recognition of marriages between people of the same sex and to allow each state to ignore such marriages sanctioned in other states. Many senators who joined the stampede against same-sex marriages voted for the bill to protect homosexuals against job discrimination to show that they were not motivated by bigotry. It is disappointing but not unexpected that both the Senate and the House have now, by overwhelming margins, voted to undercut recognition of same-sex marriages beyond the boundaries of any state that might choose to authorize them."
"Editorial says new drug to stave off symptoms of heroin withdrawal, Orlaam, seems to have advantages over methadone, but in New York, major problem for drug addicts wanting to quit is lack of clinics; notes about 85 percent of city's heroin addicts have no opportunity for treatment unless they buy methadone illegally; says most effective step would be to make treatment available to every addict who wants it ","The new drug, called Orlaam, is taken three days a week, while methadone must be taken daily. About 20 percent of addicts are expected to switch to Orlaam. Doctors like Orlaam because it adds to the limited arsenal of treatments now available for heroin addicts. New York City alone has an estimated 200,000 heroin addicts-- but only 35,000 methadone treatment slots. That leaves about 85 percent of the city's heroin addicts with no opportunity for treatment unless they buy methadone illegally.

"Federal and state officials say resignation of three Federal welfare officials will not significantly disrupt or delay work on new welfare law signed by Pres Clinton, because most of the important action has already shifted to the states; measure radically reduces role of Federal Government (M) ","The measure radically reduces the role of the Federal Government, making Federal officials like Ms. Bane almost irrelevant to state welfare programs. In the last year, the debate over welfare policy moved to the right, as President Clinton and many Democrats in Congress decided not to defend the Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children. Bane was the person who negotiated with state officials when they sought Federal permission to conduct experiments deviating from the old welfare law. The new law severely limits the Federal role, saying that Federal officials must not regulate the conduct of states except where explicitly allowed by Congress. The new law says that the Department of Health and Human Services must eliminate the jobs of 245 Federal employees, or 75 percent of the 327 who now work on welfare programs."

One law enforcement official tried to look at the results optimistically today, saying that any one of the pieces recovered from that area, once analyzed, could help solve the mystery."
"Op-Ed article by Sen Jon Kyl says he and other opponents of Chemical Weapons Convention do want to eliminate chemical weapons, including American stockpile, but they fear that under present circumstances the treaty will not accomplish its purpose and will do more harm than good; says treaty as written would create false sense of security, probably increasing dangers from weapons (M) ","The proponents of the Chemical Weapons Convention surprisingly pulled the plug on their effort to obtain immediate Senate approval of the treaty's ratification. That such serious deliberation could occur reflects great credit on both the treaty's proponents and its opponents. It would, moreover, actually aggravate the current, serious problem of chemical weapons proliferation. The treaty prohibits restrictions on trade in chemicals among its parties. It even requires them to transfer chemical technologies to other treaty members. In other words, if the United States and Iran were to ratify the convention, Teheran would have a powerful claim, under the treaty's Article XI, against American-led trade restrictions in the chemical field. The treaty would also create a false sense of security, probably increasing the dangers from these weapons."
