"Timothy Belknap letter praises Deborah Tannen's July 21 article on why some people cannot say, 'I'm sorry'; asks why others cannot say, 'I don't know' ","Deborah Tannen's article'' I'm Sorry, I Wo n't Apologize'' ( July 21 ) is first-rate in its approach to current social and power relations. I think that there is a parallel question: Why do so many people all along the chain of corporate and household command find it impossible to say,'' I do not know''?TIMOTHY BELKNAP Malden, Mass."
"Ana Areces letter on Deborah Tannen's July 21 article on why some people cannot say, I'm sorry'; says her ex-husband was one of them ","Tannen's piece on apologies-- and what they lack-- hit home with me. One of the reasons that my ex- husband is my ex is because he found it easy to say,'' I was wrong,'' but next to impossible to say,'' I'm sorry.'' The former is an intellectual acknowledgment of error, but the latter shows remorse and empathy for a fellow human being. ANA ARECES New York"
K J Steinberg faults Deborah Tannen's July 21 article on apologies for not taking a stand on this seemingly fundamental difference between men and women (S) ,Tannen's article was an apology in and of itself-- timid in its investigation of the always intriguing and seemingly inexplicable fundamental differences between men and women. Her hesitancy to assert a strong stance on the matter was discouraging and counterproductive. K. J. STEINBERG Chicago
"Denis Woychuk letter supports Megan's Law on the theory that sexual murderers and rapists of children give up all their rights, but warns that such laws promote a sense of security that is false (S) ","My congratulations for having the courage to print something other than a rousing affirmation of lifelong punishment for these offenders. As someone who was sexually molested as a child, I decided on a career specializing in the treatment of sex offenders, particularly pedophiles. Most of my patients are now leading normal lives, but they will need some form of therapy for the rest of their lives. Certain types of medication are also helpful. CAROLE J.

Susan Baum letter says literature is ahead of the movies in creating work that can inspire young women (S) ,"To the Editor: In'' The Movies Discover the Teen-Age Girl'' $ ( Aug. 11 $ ), Peggy Orenstein cites several sources of this healthy and long-overdue trend: Carol Gilligan's work, the strong voices in popular music of young women like Alanis Morissette, and some writers, notably Joyce Carol Oates. Since writing is one of the avenues that could never be entirely closed to women, a girl who loves to read can find strong role models from the 18th century on. In today's literature, the complexities of modern life are movingly traced by the many women who examine girlhood experiences: Mary Kerr, Dorothy Allison, Maya Angelou, Alice Munro, Alice McDermott and Bobbie Ann Mason, to name a few.

W Royal Stokes letter says Peggy Orenstein's August 25 article on movies with good roles for teen-age girls failed to mention the 1990 Australian film Flirting (S) ,"To the Editor: In her article, Ms. Orenstein omits mention of the splendid 1990 Australian film'' Flirting,'' in which Thandie Newton gives a winning performance as a Ugandan teen-age student at an otherwise all-white girl's boarding school. Directed by John Duigan and cast with Noah Taylor opposite Ms. Newton, this perceptive film deals very effectively with racial themes as well as the anguish of adolescence. W.

Rachel Kramer Busel letter praises the film Stealing Beauty for its portraying a a young woman (S) ,"To the Editor: I enjoyed Ms. Orenstein's illuminating article, and, as a 20-year-old female somewhere on the border of teenhood and Generation X, I'm also pleased about the recent developments in movies featuring younger women. But Lucy is also an example of a young woman thinking for herself. Yes, most of the film deals with her romantic relationships, an all-too-typical scenario for teen-age women in movies, but so does much of Alanis Morissette's music. Lucy displays just as much courage, vitality and moxie as the character Cher in'' Clueless,'' just in a different way."
Milton Goldin letter deplores dominance of classical music scene by a few superstar artists performing the same music (S) ,"It is hardly a secret that sales of classical music records are plummeting, that even great ensembles find their audiences decreasing, and that only when public funds pay most of the staggering fees demanded by superstars like Messrs. Perlman, Ma, Pavarotti and Mehta can Lincoln Center and other arts centers survive financially. And if we have come to a point at which some individuals performing the same works the same way season after season define our understanding of the literature, Leonard Bernstein may be proved a hundred percent correct: Classical music is a museum piece of interest mainly to antiquarians."
"Preston Trombly letter comments on Bernard Holland's Aug 11 column, which discussed the question of why someone would write music but did not ask any composers for an answer (S) ","To the Editor: Mr. Holland asks his readers,'' Why does anyone write a piece of music?'' He says,'' The question is not an idle one.'' It is such an important question that he feels compelled to answer it himself, by offering a number of paragraphs of opinion masquerading as fact. If Mr. Holland had posed his question to several composers of concert music, without any preconceived notions about what the proper responses'' should'' be, their answers might have formed the basis for a thought-provoking article.

"Stephen L Bayne letter says why composers write, which Bernard Holland discussed in an Aug 11 column, has little to do with what they produce (S) ","To the Editor: The title of Mr. Holland's column is negated by the contents of the column and by the history of classical music. Masterpieces and musical garbage have been written both for hire and for the sake of'' art.'' It does n't seem to matter.

A Joycean tenor onstage sang the part of the lonely desert man to the accompaniment of marimba and ukulele while Mrs. Grainger rendered the tents in a wobbly soprano offstage.

Jerome S Shipman letter replies to Larry Farsace's Aug 4 letter on Duke Ellington (S) ,"When Jolson heard their'' Swanee,'' he interpolated it into'' Sinbad,'' and his subsequent recording of the song made it Gershwin's first hit. And while Duke Ellington may have been more honest than Jolson in attributing compositions to their actual composers, he was sued by King Oliver, who claimed that his'' Camp Meeting Blues'' was appropriated by Ellington as'' Creole Love Call,'' and by Barney Bigard, who sought recognition as the co- composer of'' Mood Indigo.'' When Bigard won his suite, RCA Victor added his name to the composer credits on the labels of their records of'' Mood Indigo'' by the Ellington orchestra. DUKE ELLINGTON"
Terry McMahon letter support Frank Gehry's design for Disney Hall in Los Angeles (S) ,"To the Editor: It seems Michael Deskey would prefer us here in Los Angeles to build an ordinary'' shoebox'' of a concert hall instead of Frank Gehry's magnificent and daring design for Disney Hall $ If we are lucky enough to get the thing built, I believe that Disney Hall-- quirky, complex, risky, beautiful ( yes! ) and thoroughly modern-- will become as emblematic of Los Angeles as the Hollywood sign. Structures like concert halls mean more to cities than good acoustics and unobstructed sightlines. Imagine if the civic leaders of Sydney, in order just to get it done, and done cheaply, had decided to build a shoebox of an opera house. TERRY MCMAHON Los AngelesNO MOREWALT DISNEY HALL"

Mickey is a feckless single New York cabdriver whose ambitions do n't extend beyond getting the next fare. But he surprises everyone by marrying a charming young waitress ( Ms. Bahns ) 24 hours after she enters his cab. It's the mainstay of the Fitzpatrick vocabulary. Both sexes should find it funny and appealing despite the talk and profanity; the rock soundtrack, by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, is an added draw."

The girls-- seen in class, in the school bathroom, on the street and at home-- unite when they find out that their friend's suicide had been caused by a rape. No bloodletting, but the girls deface a boy's car. These young ladies are street-wise, and talk like it. But some teen-agers may doubt that such dissimilar young women would ever be friends in the first place."

As she noted, prices are usually quoted in dollars but payment has to be made in rubles. However, at two restaurants, their conversion to rubles added 15 to 20 percent to the bill compared with the exchange rate quoted at the nearby Astoria Hotel. IRVING AUERBACHLivingston, N.J."
"Letter by Stephen J Oustatcher on Florence Fabricant's July 28 Choice Tables article on restaurants in St Petersburg, Russia (S) ","She was completely correct about hotel dining. I was on an all-inclusive tour so almost all my meals were in the hotel dining rooms. Mashed potatoes soaked in butter, hard cheeses and salami with pearl-sized pieces of fat in it were standard fare. I did have the opportunity to eat at the Grand Europe Hotel, and it was an exceptional experience. When we agreed she took us to Skoda, one of the many small restaurants in the hotel. Three servings of hot borscht with one serving of potatoes with cheese and caviar cost $ 52, fairly reasonable by New York standards. Two of my friends went back to the Grand Europe Hotel for dinner that night because they noticed a fixed-price dinner of seafood salad, grilled salmon and a souffle for dessert for $ 34."
Letter by Stan Goldfarb urges travelers to be cautious when placing personal belongings on security checkpoints at airports; says case that contained his airline tickets and passport disappeared from fanny pack he placed on X-ray belt; notes police found the case within five minutes (S) ,"At the Calgary airport security checkpoint, I was asked to remove my fanny pack and place it on the X-ray belt. I retrieved my hand luggage and fanny pack and my wife picked up her purse. At our gate, I opened a pocket of the fanny pack that contained my airline tickets and passport case. The case was missing. I reported the incident to a police officer, who returned within five minutes with another policeman who was holding the case. It is obvious that someone removed the case from my fanny pack, did n't see the cash and credit cards inside and threw it back on the end of the belt. A lesson learned: remove your wallet from your purse or fanny pack before the security check."

Further, anyone who ingested such chemicals, no matter how pleasurable to them, would be looked on as fit for an insanity defense. They have no right to poison others and to put them at risk by fire.

"Home buyers are increasingly tailoring their mortgages by calculating how long they are likely to stay in a house and then selecting a loan suited to the calculation; while the stable, standard 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage remains dominant, more buyers than ever are choosing newer varieties of adjustable-rate mortgages that promise fixed-rate certainty for a set number of years before applying fluctuating rates; chart; photos (M) ","They bought their house with a type of adjustable mortgage that holds the interest rate steady for the first five years, and then allows it to fluctuate.''

Points are, effectively, a prepayment of interest, and therefore lower the interest rate."

"Alvin Klein on regional theaters in New Jersey; asserts that it is imperative that nonprofit theaters maintain artistic integrity that transcends 'dilettante, nebulous, tourist-driven, expense-account' theater; photos (M)&#xFFFD; ","NOW, for a low-stress theater quiz. Not to worry: you do n't have to be a theater junkie to take it. The first three plays had their American premieres at the McCarter Theater in Princeton. The next three came from Crossroads Theater Company in New Brunswick. Regional theater was conceived for its community. Once the money people affect artistic decisions, the theater is no longer in control of its repertory. And artistic directors will not admit that their theaters are tryout centers for Broadway. Paper Mill's credo is as close as can be to that of a commercial theater without actually making it one. It stands to reason that regional theaters will reach out for new strategies to fight for their lives. Let the theater flaunt its Tony."

James W Prescott letter comments on Aug 20 article on effects of new welfare-reform law on sentencing of welfare mothers who are felons (M) ,"Substantial scientific evidence has documented the failure of maternal-infant affectional bonding as a major cause of depression, alienation, anger or rage, violence and substance abuse. Animal studies have documented that prolonged maternal-infant separation results in a variety of developmental brain abnormalities that include alterations of the structure, neurochemistry and neuroelectrical activity of brain cells. The consequences upon brain development and behavior are compounded by the lack of breast feeding, which deprives the newborn of essential nutrients not found in formula milk. That judicial colleagues of Judge Wald on the Court of Appeals have discounted the importance of mother-infant affectional bonding and of breast feeding for the prevention of violence and substance abuse is appalling. Imprisonment of women with children is a guarantee for the establishment of a next generation of violent offenders and drug abusers."

The dispute between the New York City Board of Education and such worthy institutions as the New York Civil Liberties Union and the local National Organization for Women chapters over a separate public junior high school for girls in East Harlem, which the Board of Education has voted to endorse and expand into an all-girls' high school ( news article, Aug. 22 ), illustrates how crude applications of the equality principle lead well-meaning people astray. Separate education for girls entails no deprivation of boys. The writer is an associate professor of philosophy at Brooklyn College."

Perhaps no single place in Bosnia witnessed more of the war's horror than Kosevo Hospital, a huge complex of boxy buildings on a hill in north Sarajevo that sat in clear sight of Bosnian Serb shelling positions. Dr. Fuad Sisic, a chief surgeon here, published a grimly illustrated book this year on the art of war medicine. In 1992, for example, the hospital treated 22,549 people wounded. The worst day that year was June 8, when 332 people came in wounded. In 1992, eight people were killed and many more were wounded in a mortar attack in the old town of Sarajevo."

Drug abuse and its related crime and violence are wreaking havoc with our country, not least among the poorest segments of our society. While we must redouble our efforts at home, the most harmful drugs-- cocaine, heroin and most methamphetamines-- originate outside United States borders. Funds allocated to combat drug trafficking overseas make up only 5 percent of the Federal drug budget. We also support efforts to eradicate drug crops and create alternative economic options. But in the long run, they will benefit all countries involved by helping to stop drugs at the source and preventing drug traffickers from creating narco-democracies."

The treaty in question is the Missile Technology Control Regime, a pact signed by about 30 countries. In November 1991, the Chinese, prompted by the United States, agreed to follow the provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime. The Chinese subsequently broke their word by shipping M-11 missile technology to Pakistan, and broke it again by selling to the Pakistanis specialized magnets that can be used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons, according to United States intelligence and arms-control officials. The construction of the suspected missile factory may constitute a third violation of the regime, Government officials said today."

Mr. de Waal rightly points out that science lags behind what common sense and anecdotal evidence keep telling us: that animals can suffer, think, plan, deceive and cherish. But there is a larger point he should have pursued. If this evidence is to be believed, we must rethink our relationship to animals like Binti. If science wishes to argue that we can not know what was going on in Binti's head when she acted as she did, science must also acknowledge that it can not prove that nothing was going on.

New research suggests that nitric oxide helps the body defend itself against malaria and that nitric oxide levels might even be a key factor in determining whether a child will get a milder form of the disease or a life-threatening one; findings run counter to other published theories (M) ,"Directed by Dr. Nicholas Anstey, the team of researchers measured nitric oxide levels in the blood and urine of 191 Tanzanian children between the ages of 6 months and 9 years. Of 141 with malaria, 86 had the cerebral form. The very sickest children with cerebral malaria had the lowest levels of nitric oxide, and the highest levels were found in the children who remained healthy despite being infected with malaria organisms. The very sickest children did have high levels of tumor necrosis factor, he said, and the researchers expected that to lead to high nitric oxide levels as well, as Dr. Clark had predicted. Drugs that might increase nitric oxide levels would likely have serious side effects,'' he said,'' and these are very ill patients."

Robert Schumann thus remained the only interloper in the program, but a striking one with Helene Grimaud playing his Piano Concerto in A minor. In concert and on disk, most recently in an Erato recording of Brahms's late piano works, she has contributed especially interesting work in the Germanic repertory.

"Artifacts discovered in the slave quarters of an 18th-century town house in Annapolis, Md, suggest that the slaves of lived there, although they had been baptized Christians, still practiced African rituals, including those used to honor and call up the spirits of ancestors, cast healing spells, protect against harm and divine the future; discoveries are product of a growing emphasis on the long-neglected African element in American archeology; photos (M) ","They are secrets of the early American slave culture. Many scholars eschew such terms as pejorative, preferring to call these the ritual practices of African traditional religion.

As they learned of the similarities between their artifacts and ritual materials in West Africa, Dr. Leone and Ms. Jones felt sure that they had made an important discovery about African religious practices among African-American slaves. Fry said the artifacts discovered reflected three concerns that led the slaves to fall back on the religious practices of their African heritage.

The crackdown on advertising aims to save young people from becoming tobacco addicts by eliminating seductive ads. Only a tool of Big Bad Tobacco wants to quarrel about the goodness of that. So Big Bad Tobacco goes to court. Will the Government proceed to regulate whisky ads? Yet there is no zealous public attack on Big Bad Beer similar to the campaign against tobacco. Television floods its sports coverage with seductive beer ads, usually linking them with seductive automobile ads in which young folk speed all over the tube. Will the Feds crack down on these ads too? After putting the boot into Big Bad Tobacco, doing likewise to Big Booze, Big Beer and Big Internal Combustion would be dumb politics."

The program got off to a colorful start with Diane Vivona's'' Goldfish Variations,'' set to music by Michael Wiesse and Debussy. The solo tried to establish connections between women and fish, but what stood out were the imaginative sets for each of the dance's two parts. Wearing a costume that suggested both a stripper and a fish, Ms. Vivona undulated and stretched on a stage gleaming with three inhabited fishbowls and then darted beneath a witty mobile of a large fish. The costume was by Ms. Fin and Louisa Laurie. Ms. Vivona wrote the vivid text."

Gerard Schwarz conducted the festival orchestra, joined by the Pro Arte Chorale and four vocal soloists at Avery Fisher Hall, in a performance of Handel's'' Messiah'' in the seldom-heard 1789 arrangement Mozart made for his friend and sometime patron Baron van Swieten. In the bass aria'' For who shall abide,'' Mozart catches the sparks of the refiner's fire with flecks of wind color.

In a previous study, Dr. Meyer and his colleagues used DNA from the fish to estimate how much time the Lake Victoria cichlids had to diverge into hundreds of different species. What they found was that the cichlids in Lake Victoria were extremely closely related, having diverged very recently; surprisingly few genetic differences were detected among them.

It wound up being a highly entertaining game, anyway. Mariano Duncan followed Strawberry's single with what seemed to be an ineffective play: he hit a pop fly to shallow right field. Boehringer, who won his first major league game with five and one-third unblemished innings against the Angels last Tuesday, replaced Key and helped himself by holding the Mariners to one hit in seven at-bats with runners in scoring position. Edgar Martinez smacked a ball along the first-base line that Martinez dived to smother. Griffey rocked a one-out double to right in the still scoreless game and then Edgar Martinez smashed a 1- 0 pitch to deep right-center."

The airline industry has never'' lobbied'' against needed improvements to our security system. The mere fact that the vendor of a new technology or the author of some new idea to'' improve security'' says that idea or technology is the key does not make it so. The airline industry requires expertise in security, and that is why it turned to William Webster, the former F.B.I. director, for guidance.

We were known as'' sky marshals,'' and we rode the planes, armed and under cover, to prevent hijackings. When not flying, we performed baggage and passenger searches before boarding. This program lasted until 1973, when the force was disbanded and responsibility for pre-boarding security was turned over to the airlines. We had hoped that the United States would keep us on as an air security police force. Instead, all this experience and expertise in air security was lost. Do n't Oppose Security Improvements"

"Business is lagging in Tijuana, Mex, which for years has been staging area for Mexicans seeking to cross US border illegally; situation is consequence of 22-month Border Patrol operation near San Diego in which hundreds of agents, ground sensors and night-vision equipment have been deployed to turn back thousands massed each night along most porous stretch of frontier; map (M) ","But in a reflection of recent efforts by the United States to stem the flow of illegal immigration here, many merchants along this stretch of the border say their fortunes are now lagging. The dearth of customers is a consequence of a 22-month Border Patrol operation near San Diego called Gatekeeper. The Border Patrol added hundreds of agents, ground sensors and night-vision equipment in an effort to turn back the thousands of migrants massed each night along the nation's most porous stretch of frontier. And in any case, pressure by the Border Patrol at San Diego is forcing migrants to the east, in the rugged mountains and high deserts of rural San Diego County and Arizona. Ironically, many of the peddlers who work just yards from the border have never ventured onto United States soil."

And since the five existing stations broadcast from Bosnian Government territory, getting the Government's cooperation was the first step."

Therefore, from an absolute point of view, we all deserve the fires of hell. This view of the issue is accepted by the majority of Christians today, half of whom say they are evangelical, by the way.

It is new for biblical scholars to question whether Jesus actually made any claim to be the only way to God, but Christian tradition has always included witnesses who tell of meeting the one God in Christ and knowing that God to embrace all humanity in unconditional welcome. Conditional salvation breeds persecutions and pogroms, forced conversions and inquisitions; all these horrors have been encouraged by Christian theologians and teachers in the name of'' compassion for the unsaved'' and have reduced Christianity to the cult of a vengeful tribal deity.(Rev. ) St. Gregory's Episcopal Church San Francisco, Aug. 23, 1996"

However, President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey gave an unscheduled speech.

Each year there, we watch families come together at noon and night for meals. Women and men grow their own vegetables, buy local fish and meat and prepare their meals without fuss or bother. The President, or perhaps Hillary, should answer Alice and indeed have an organic vegetable and herb garden. The nation would benefit more from organic vegetable gardens than from artificial and pesticide-laced lawns. Vegetables grow very well interspersed with flowers. Let's return to vegetable gardens and meals cooked with tender loving care, eaten with family and friends."

Peter Watrous reviews the trombonists Wycliffe Gordon and Ronald Westray and band at Village Vanguard; photo (M) ,"Gordon loves an early jazz sensibility, where sound and texture-- all the huffing and growls and buzzes of the swing era-- are as important as the notes themselves. Mr. Westray is more mathematical, preferring odd unbalanced lines, long pure notes and permutations of ideas that perforate harmonies. Since the early 1960's, when jazz began mirroring the political and social struggles of the country, the trombone has mostly fallen out of favor as not serious or facile enough. Another used early New Orleans rhythms to approximate something Charles Mingus could have written. The music had all the shifting emotional centers brought on by dissonances and conflicting chords, the incidental and casual wisps of darkness and light that polyphony brings to jazz. JAZZ REVIEW"
Lawrence Hyman letter comments on James R Kelly's Aug 25 letter on abortion (S) ,"But how can we explain why the majority of people in this country and in many other countries support abortion, capital punishment, nuclear weapons and euthanasia in some cases?We can do so by recognizing that an ethical principle that is as general and abstract as'' life is better than death'' must be interpreted differently by different people when confronted with actual cases. Similarly, those who support the ending of the life of a deformed embryo or of someone who has an incurable disease that is causing only suffering are not choosing death over life but rather action that would cause less suffering to all involved."
Sylvia Drew Ivie letter disputes Maureen Dowd's Aug 25 column on Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole (S) ,"To the Editor: Writing about Bob Dole's reflections on racial segregation of blood used for transfusions for American soldiers during World War II, Maureen Dowd ( column, Aug. 25 ) says that he was'' intense and affecting.'' At first, the Army rejected all donations of blood from African-Americans; then, in a compromise, it instructed the Red Cross to accept donations from blacks but to label and separate the blood. The American Red Cross complied. While agreeing that the policy had no scientific validity, Normal H. Davis, the Red Cross chairman, argued that'' the question really is whether or not the views of the majority of those for whom the blood is being produced... Not until 1963 did the Red Cross eliminate the practice."
Brad Masoni letter comments on Aug 27 article on passage of legislation in California calling for chemical castration of those convicted of heinous sex crimes (S) ,"To the Editor: Although I am impressed with your impartial treatment of California's proposal for'' chemical castration'' ( front page, Aug. 27 ), I am disappointed that any law-making body is considering such a measure. Rape, child molestation and other sex crimes are reprehensible, but they have been mislabeled: these violent crimes are not driven by the desire for sex but by the desire to assert power over another. The threat of castration may well be an ideological deterrent. But these criminals will almost certainly find another way to assert power over another. Until we recognize these crimes for what they are and create effective punishments, the justice system will remain only marginally effective. BRAD MASONINew York, Aug. 27, 1996"
Letter from Pakistan Amb Zamir Akram disputes Aug 26 article on US suspicions that China is helping Pakistan build missile factory (S) ,"To the Editor: It is regrettable that in your Aug. 26 news article suggesting that the United States suspects China is helping Pakistan build a missile factory you did not devote a few lines to the denial of this charge by the Pakistani and Chinese embassies. Vice President Al Gore's comments on Sunday on'' This Week With David Brinkley'' do not justify the inference you draw that the United States is aware that such a factory is being built.

Matthew Howard letter backs proposal by Martina Navratilova that women's tennis be changed to best-of-five format (S) ,"To the Editor: Martina Navratilova's proposal that women's tennis matches be extended to a best-of-five-sets format ( Op-Ed, Aug. 26 ) would have an additional benefit: contests that reward the endurance and stamina of older, more mature athletes. That change would be welcome for a sport in which young players are often pressured to compete at the highest level before they are mentally or emotionally ready. Maybe the rigors of five-set matches might even force some talented players to devote their teen-age years to pursuits other than the professional tour-- like high school.

Daniel F Styer letter disputes Aug 23 article on genetic seuqencing of Methanococcus microbe (S) ,"To the Editor: Your Aug. 23 news article on the genetic sequencing of the Methanococcus microbe begins by saying that'' scientists have the dullest of creation myths,'' contrasting the scientific story with stories about Adam and Aphrodite. But the scientific story of life's origins is far more exciting and surprising than anything dreamed up by the ancients. What creation myth describes organisms that live in hot springs at the bottom of the sea? Which ancient would dare dream up a story about creatures that use iron-containing chemicals as an energy source? 1996The writer is an associate professor of physics at Oberlin College."
David Heyman letter disputes Chester E Finn's Aug 24 Op-Ed article on public education (S) ,"He lauds publicly financed charter schools and notes that such schools are free to hire noncertified teachers if they wish. But in approving of this freedom, Mr. Finn fails to acknowledge that requirements like teacher certification serve to protect and enhance the education of our young people. Not to require that charter-school teachers be certified is like giving a meat-packing plant Government approval without requiring that it conform to government standards. The certification process insures that a teacher has adequate preparation in both subject matter and in teaching and classroom management through evaluation of the teacher-applicant. Finn fails to mention that for those who do not subscribe to the public model of education, there is the private and independent school system. In advocating charter schools, Mr. Finn wants to have his cake and eat it: public dollars without public protection."
"James Grauer, architect, alters ceiling height of the Battery Park City apartment of David Wine to give it some graceful curves and definition; photos (M) ","By modeling rather than tearing out walls, Mr. Gauer thus managed to solve one of the apartment's most pressing disadvantages: its lack of definition.''The floor plan existed in a kind of nondescript netherworld where there were not quite rooms, nor open spaces either,'' Mr. Gauer recalled.'' The L-shaped condo with dining alcove had some fine points, primarily tall windows on two sides of the main room that offered a spectacular view of the Hudson River. Gauer started by rethinking the L-shaped space to take advantage of the view. Thus Mr. Gauer created an elliptical curve that outlines the formerly undefined living room. With the boxy living room swept up in generous curves, that left plenty of room for a proper dining area."

His 10-year collaboration with Brian Kulick, the play's director, has resulted in numerous abstract set designs.''A wall has so many psychological connotations, as does a box,'' Mr. Wendland said.'' Actors ( stagehands ) whirl the huge box into place lengthwise, revealing four 10-foot-square compartments, not unlike a floor-through apartment or a Southern shotgun house. But he did have a few moments of doubt over integrating the actors to the box.'' The last minute of the play is Mr. Wendland's favorite visual moment: the box disappears."

Jon Pareles reviews Beck concert at the Supper Club; photo (M) ,"Beck knows better than to believe in a rock singer's authenticity. Other songs drew on hard-rock power chords, 1960's garage-rock riffs, 1970's funk keyboards, hip-hop chants and, everywhere, Bob Dylan's visionary free-associations, which suit the overloaded 1990's as well as they fit the wide-open 1960's. At the time, he worked the alternative-rock circuit and turned his own songs into lackadaisical or noisy rubble, as if to assert his post-punk credentials and insist he was n't overly commercial. He also played a few songs alone on a guitar, like a coffee-house singer, including one that simply repeated,'' whose incredible harmonica style I'm about to give a bad name.'' Actually, he did n't do badly, playing Terry's locomotive huffing chords and train-whistle hoots."

Yukio Hatoyama, a member of one of Japan's most prominent families, said he would form a yet-unnamed new party in several weeks. As a result, he resigned from New Party Sakigake, the smallest of the three parties that together rule Japan. Some experts say that in the long run there is an opportunity for a new, dynamic party in Japan. Mr. Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party is the dominant member of the coalition, and it is joined by Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party."

"Elder law becomes a booming legal specialty because of the aging of American population; one part of practice, known as Medicaid estate planning, is targeted in the health-insurance bill just signed by Pres Clinton, which makes it a criminal offense to dispose of assets in order to obtain Medicaid benefits, primarily for nursing-home care; drawing (M) ","Over the last decade, 57 law schools in the United States have established elder-law courses and clinics, and 20 state bar associations, including New York's, have set up elder-law sections.

But Medicaid planning makes up less than 10 percent of what elder-law specialists do, said Ira S. Wiesner of Sarasota, Fla., who is president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys. Virtually all the other combined assets must go for the one spouse's Medicaid care. Long-term-care insurance, to cover nursing-home and home-care costs, is an alternative to Medicaid planning.
