Guinn and other researchers say that people who consume blood include both occasional thrill seekers taking their fascination with vampire mythology to new heights ( or depths ) and true believers enacting a sexual fetish, pagan ceremony, psychological affliction or combination of all three. Blood drinkers come from the worlds of both vampire enthusiasts and sexual sadomasochists, representing a small minority in each, experts say."

"Gov Mike Huckabee of Arkansas refuses to authorize a Medicaid payment for an abortion performed on a 15-year-old girl whose stepfather has been charged with incest, despite a Federal court order that such payments are required by Federal law; cites state constitutional amendment barring use of public money for abortion except when a mother's life is endangered (M) ","Through a spokesman, Mr. Huckabee said his first obligation was to obey the Arkansas State Constitution, rather than Federal law. In that action, an anti-abortion advocate is seeking an order compelling Arkansas's withdrawal from the Medicaid program because of the state constitutional provision. A part of the state's position has been that the case is moot because no one in Arkansas has sought Medicaid reimbursement for an abortion before. In the current fiscal year, Federal payments to Arkansas's $ 1.3 billion Medicaid program will approach $ 990 million. But so would the lawsuit in state court. The Court returned the case to Judge Wilson, who today found that under Federal law, the state had to provide Medicaid reimbursements for abortions in cases of rape and incest."

Pres Ernesto Samper of Colombia urges central bank to devalue country's currency to help make exports more attractive in global market; central bank has insisted that country's exchange rate system will not be changed and has spent more than $300 million from its international reserves this year to defend peso (S) ,"The President of Colombia, Ernesto Samper, urged the central bank yesterday to devalue the country's currency, the peso, to help make exports more attractive in the global market. The central bank has insisted that the country's exchange rate system, which is intended to keep the currency within a narrow range against the dollar, will not be changed. A Colombian devaluation might not hurt the economy as much as Mexico's currency devaluation of its currency in 1994, which led to an economic crisis throughout Latin America. Mexico had a soaring current-account deficit and was heavily dependent on short-term debt and foreign investment to finance it. Foreign investment in Colombia tends to be longer term, lessening the fears of capital flight.(Bloomberg Business News)INTERNATIONAL BRIEFS"

Bob Dole's reported selection of Jack Kemp as his Vice Presidential running mate follows weeks in which Dole aides believed such a choice was impossible because the two men have had such a contentious relationship for years; a Dole delay in telephoning Kemp causes two anxious hours for aides; photo (M) ,"Mr. Dole's emissaries had already been dispatched to promote Mr. Kemp's qualifications to reporters. That night, Mr. Dole met with Mr. Kemp, at the Watergate apartment complex where the Doles live in Washington. The talks between Mr. Kemp and top Dole aides continued on Thursday. But some people close to Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp said Mr. Dole made his decision on Thursday night. People close to Mr. Dole said they grew to realize that their candidate would put aside his past frictions with Mr. Kemp. But at a breakfast just over a week ago, Mr. Kemp did not sound as though he thought he was a prospect. Asked why he had not been mentioned as a running mate, Mr. Kemp replied:'' You have to ask Bob Dole."

Kemp as his running mate, Bob Dole emulated the two most successful Republican politicians since World War II, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. That is Mr. Dole's job. From Mr. Kemp's viewpoint, though, Mr. Dole's nod could prove a turning point. Kemp could help Mr. Dole in several ways, all subtle, none decisive but all quite worthwhile. He and Mr. Dole have never been close and have often differed on major issues, but it is entirely in character for Mr. Kemp to join Mr. Dole at this point. In one area at least Mr. Kemp will appeal to moderate Republicans and perhaps some Democrats as well. Had he not had trouble, it was doubtful he would have turned to Mr. Kemp."

It was Espinoza's second home run with the Mets and tied the game after the Marlins had scored an unearned run off Person in the fourth. But the promising start quickly fizzled when Castillo, playing second base, fielded a lazy ground ball by Lance Johnson in time to tag out Tomberlin running to second and throw to first to get Johnson on a double play. The unearned run he allowed in the fourth was his own doing. The right-hander, who was making his first National League start, gave up only the solo home run to Espinoza in the sixth inning."

Airline passengers are warned that tighter security procedures will lengthen check-in times and may well cause inconvenience to travelers (S) ,"Even before President Clinton's July 25 order requiring airports to tighten security procedures, many airports had started doing so on their own. At airports from Philadelphia to Dallas-Fort Worth, tow trucks are out in force to haul away unattended vehicles, and police and security guards are under orders to confiscate unattended baggage. It also said state police would augment the airport force. Airport administrators and airlines are usually reluctant to talk about specific security procedures, for fear of tipping their hand. In a rare breaking of this custom, United Airlines-- on the day before Mr. Clinton issued the new rules for airports-- said it would not accept small packages without opening them first, and that it would require two forms of identification from anyone checking such packages."

Joan Lee Faust article on gardening with coleus; drawing (M) ,"Coleus are mintlike plants that have the family tendency to spread. Although most gardens are planned to continue a truly splendid flower display all through the summer months, many plants take a back seat. This sort of reasoning makes a strong case for greater use of plants with variegated or otherwise show-off foliage. Every year sees more and more newcomers to this grand category of plants. In fact, entire gardens have been planted with these splendid foliage plants and the effect can be truly spectacular. This is also one of those that is dramatic when sprigs are planted in containers to spill their display seasonally. Then there are two rather obvious plants with variegated foliage, each special in its own ways. But there are a few specialists who do stock these unusual plants."

"Lawrence B Johnson comments on attributes of sonic naturalness, transparency and neutrality in loudspeakers; comments on new speaker unveiled in US by Linn Hi-Fi of Scotland, the AV-5140, which comes closest to sonic invisibility of any speaker he has ever heard; drawing (M) ","Audio critics occasionally call such speakers transparent and uncolored. And that realization points to another critical factor in one's subjective response to a speaker: frame of reference. The client, a speaker manufacturer, asked the reviewer what ideal was in his mind's ear when he listened to a new speaker. The answer: other speakers he liked. It is far easier to ascribe a very beautiful, very convincing speaker sound ( or musical performance ) to some state of perfect neutrality or cosmic connection than to analyze the intellectual and emotional elements of one's response. Like the concert performance that seems to offer a clear window on the musical work itself, a speaker may reproduce sound in so involving a fashion that one loses consciousness of the'' interpretive'' device."

"Peter Watrous comments on Robert Altman's new film Kansas City, and movie's treatment of jazz and its use of jazz musicians; photo (M) ","It has turned the music and the musicians into servants of the plot and the film's ambiance. As a kidnapping unfolds involving high-level white politicians and a black gangster, the music blares.''Kansas City'' is good-hearted in that it uses actual young musicians playing actual music. But irrespective of the film makers' intentions, the film treats the musicians as mutes, without a story to tell. But oddly, unlike older Hollywood movies that it is clearly derived from,'' Kansas City'' does n't even let the musicians have a speaking role. In both cases, Hollywood uses jazz-- or its musicians-- as a vehicle for other goals. Recent American films on jazz musicians are n't much better."
"Tom Wicker finds that national political conventions have turned into national bore; recalls time when national political conventions were dramatic, filled with speculation, anticipation and excitement, about candidates, platforms, policies and nation's future; photos (M)&#xFFFD; ","National political conventions had been a dramatic, and original, American political institution since the early 19th century. Franklin D. Roosevelt's acceptance speech in 1932-- again in Chicago, the parties' favorite convention city-- was the first to be broadcast nationally.

"Environmental and civic groups on Long Island are rallying in support of $1.75 billion environmental bond issue before the voters in November, which could provide the region with hundreds of millions of dollars (M) ","IN 1990 New Yorkers rejected a $ 1.9 billion environmental bond act in a move that suggested that voters had limits to what they would pay for environmental programs, particularly in a recession. Environmental and civic groups are lining up to support the bond issue, along with other groups in the state. In November, as in 1990, strong support for environmental initiatives on Long Island will be pivotal. Part of that money would be available to buy land in the Long Island pine barrens, the largest reserve of drinking water in the region. What's good about a bond act is that you can get public support behind it, and it bodes well for a lot of other environmental issues around the state."

Peter Canby reviews book A New Time for Mexico by Carlos Fuentes; translated by Marina Gutman Castaneda and the author (L) ,"A New Time For Mexico By Carlos Fuentes. The postrevolutionary Government was, according to Mr. Fuentes, a regime that managed to be at once authoritarian and progressive. At the present time, however, Mr. Fuentes is concerned about what he sees as a greater problem. It's hard to fault Mr. Fuentes for any of these eminently sensible ideas, but it's also hard to take them too seriously. Mr. Fuentes is like a good dinner guest. Yet nowhere, beyond a'' Jurassic Park'' joke or two, does Mr. Fuentes address the critical issue of the effects of the drug trade on Mexican politics. It is briefly amusing to hear Mr. Marcos and Mr. Fuentes trading oracular pronouncements as if they were on an episode of'' Star Trek.''"

Nancy Maull reviews book Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology by Paul Rabinow (L) ,"He explores specifically the polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., a procedure developed in a biotechnology company called Cetus. An underlying anxiety throughout'' Making PCR'' is the question: What happens to nice scientific values when they move into the corporate world? What happens when biology moves into the for-profit world? Mr. Rabinow points out that academic scientists rightly worry about the commercial exploitation of information, unwarranted corporate secrecy and perhaps, most critically, a loss of investigative autonomy, along with tenure. A consequence of these weighed advantages and alternatives is that corporate mores never simply appropriate or dissolve academic values. The new corporations bear the genetic marks of their university ancestry."

Rubin is excellent in sketching the peculiarities of Afghan history. This arrangement held under Stalin, who maintained correct relations with the Afghan king, even sparing him from a Moscow-inspired Communist Party. Not until 1965, when the Soviets moved aggressively toward the third world, was an Afghan party founded. In Moscow, Kremlin hard-liners like Mikhail Suslov argued that the collapse of the Afghan revolution would imperil Communist regimes everywhere. This was our man in Afghanistan because Pakistan wanted an Islamic fundamentalist regime in Kabul. The King was willing, and a poll taken by the respected Afghan writer and poet Sayd Majrooh showed that Afghan refugees in Pakistan overwhelmingly preferred Zahir Shah to any resistance leader."

One day, so the story goes, he rammed the police boat with his lobster boat. Examples: $ 120 for reckless boating, $ 420 for boating while intoxicated. One boater on the Connecticut River, Mr. Healy said, has been circumventing the regulation by having a blow-up doll sitting in his boat. In the five-year period from 1986 through 1990, boating fatalities in the state totaled 48. They are the fastest-growing segment in boating but not necessarily the most welcome. Since then, several bills on boating safety have become law in Connecticut, including those on reckless boating and boating while drunk. By Oct. 1, 1997, all boat operators must be certified."

Julian Bond letter disputes assertions by Prof William Julius Wilson in his July 14 review of Richard D Kahlenberg book The Remedy (S) ,"Among the many vital jobs to be done, the nation must not only radically readjust its attitude toward the Negro in the compelling present, but must incorporate in its planning some compensatory consideration for the handicaps he has inherited from the past.

"Connecticut Tennis Center in New Haven has not raised the revenue that was hoped for when it was built as multipurpose stadium five years ago with state funds raised in a bond issue; it has not held a music concert since 1994; Jewell Productions, which promotes the Pilot Pen International tournament there for one week a year, seems to be the only beneficiary (M) ","WHEN the Connecticut Tennis Center opened near the Yale Bowl in New Haven five years ago, many residents of the nearby Westville section expressed concern about noise before, during and after projected concerts in the 15,000-seat stadium.

Staging a big-money tennis tournament in a publicly financed stadium in one of the nation's poorest cities seems incongruous to many.

Janet Heit letter on May 19 article on loft movement (S) ,"In lay terms, the Loft Law equates fine artists with small manufacturers, and contains a provision entitling them to live where they work.

Now SoHo has so many chain stores all it needs is a roof, climate control and a food court, and it is so expensive that the struggling artist can no longer afford to live there. The Giuliani administration should designate new districts permitting artist-only live / work spaces. Short of commercial rent control, this is the only means of keeping our city's artist community from leaving town."

The problems arise on more congested roads where drivers are often forced to make a complete stop at the bottom of the ramp and then gun the engine and dive into traffic without benefit of merge lanes.''Cloverleafs are not held in high regard among highway engineers,'' said William A. Prosser, highway design engineer with the Federal Highway Administration, who reviews all new interchange proposals.'' The plan for the new-look Woodbridge interchange is as follows: Build longer ramps to new, street-level intersections with additional left-turn lanes."
"New Jersey Shakespeare Festival to begin $6.5 million renovation of Bowne Theater at Drew University, scheduled to open in 1998; architect's rendering (S) ","WHEN Bonnie J. Monte took over as artistic director of the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival in 1990, she fell heir to a theater'' in a total state of disrepair,'' she recalls.'' Appalling,'''' exhausted'' and'' inaccessible'' are some of the other words that Ms. Monte and Michael Stotts, the festival's managing director, use to describe the 244-seat Bowne Theater at Drew University in Madison. Once a gymnasium, it has sufficed, but barely, as the festival's main stage since 1972.Next spring, the festival is to begin expanding the Bowne. On July 30, the New Jersey Council on the Arts allotted $ 2.5 million to the theater's renovation and expansion. The 1998 season is expected to open in a new 325-seat theater."
Alvin Klein reviews New Jersey Shakespeare Festival production of The Winter's Tale; photo (M) ,"The perennial Shakespearean puzzlement, with its obstructions to rationality, is part royal tragedy, part rustic idyll, part romantic fable, none coalescing, all confounding. Yet directors of vision-- Michael Langham at the Guthrie Theater, in Minneapolis, Ingmar Bergman at the Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden, Adrian Noble at the Royal Shakespeare Company-- have orchestrated unwieldly elements, restoring balance and finding illumination. At the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, Scott Wentworth, who frames the production with the image of a child reading, disclaims reality, telling the audience right off that it's only make-believe. Mr. Wentworth is invoking story magic; Ms. Adler is making acting magic. THE WINTER'S TALENew Jersey Shakespeare Festival Bowne Theater, Drew University,36 Madison Avenue, MadisonThrough Saturday."

Regional stock brokerage firms in various areas of country note some of their favorite locally-based companies; map; advice on investing in such companies through regional brokers (S) ,"One way to do it is through regional brokerage firms. Like small investors, many regional firms scour their areas for up-and-coming companies to recommend to clients. Partly because mutual funds and pension funds have made it a practice to find investment ideas missed by big Wall Street firms, finding undiscovered stocks is not easy. Good stock ideas from regional brokerage firms are not always snapped up by the big guys. What constitutes an overlooked stock?

"Airline cutbacks in food service discussed; major carriers now offer hot meals only on flights longer than 700 or 1,000 miles, and only at meal times, but connections at hub airports often break up flights, leaving travelers quite hungry; map; airlines, which serve more food on competitive routes, insist they hear few complaints from passengers more interested in lower fares (S) ","Moreover, that policy is only for flights during meal hours. While the average airline trip is just under 1,000 miles, which would qualify passengers for a hot meal on most airlines, many flights connect at hub airports, breaking that 1,000-mile trip into two or more legs. Airlines spent roughly $ 4.45 on meals per passenger in 1995, down from about $ 5.60 in 1992. While many passengers are resigned to flights without food, particularly since the proliferation of no-frills carriers, some travelers are still disappointed that major carriers offer less than a full meal. At United, flight attendants who work at least nine hours are entitled to a meal. And meal hours are usually ignored on flights between New York and Chicago, where competition for business travelers just about assures passengers a meal."

As we move toward the 21st century we read about the Long Island Association's looking to attract new industry There is no industry that would move to Long Island when they face the traffic problems which ultimately prohibit industry from moving about the Island. We must immediately begin to build a monorail system that will move people to and from various key points on Long Island and Manhattan.

Given these somewhat astonishing statistics, one wonders why medications are so often the only recommended treatment for depression. They frequently discount or ignore the results of empirical research on depression treatment. Proper treatment, using the results of well-designed and well-conducted scientific research is."

Although legislative and executive action is a better way to resolve social problems, at times judges must step in.

Daniel Mendelsohn reviews book Servant of the Bones by Anne Rice; drawing (L) ,"New York: Rice's latest supernatural melodrama,'' Servant of the Bones,'' is dedicated to God, and if God has any commercial savvy whatsoever, He'll dedicate His next book to her. In Ms. Rice's case, her popularity seems, if anything, to have grown in inverse proportion to the readability of each new and ever more unwieldy novel. Yet Ms. Rice has always seen herself as much more than the kudzu- crowned, fog-caped Queen to Stephen King's King. Although it mocks you with parallels to her earlier, better books-- its eponymous protagonist, the dark angel Azriel, is, like Louis, a kind of outcast spirit-- its garrulous gods, horny angels and'' Dr. Babylon, the Middle Ages, New York Jews."
Patrick McGrath reviews book A Lazy Eye: Stories by Mary Morrissy; drawing (L) ,"$ 21.THERE is a recurring plot sequence in this elegantly written and grimly perceptive collection of stories by the Irish writer Mary Morrissy-- a two-step process involving first a character's humiliation and then her attempt at compensation. In the title story, a young woman named Bella Carmichael is traveling by train in Europe. A Curse,'' one of the strongest stories in the collection, is about a young girl named Clara, who works for a family that is expecting a new baby. It is a nice illustration of what psychiatry calls'' displacement of affect.''Such displacements recur throughout Ms. Morrissy's stories. In'' Divided Attention,'' a woman bedeviled by obscene phone calls takes to making anonymous calls of her own-- to her former lover, a married man with a family."

The espionage success was considered so great that the Halibut received a Presidential award in a secret ceremony.

The Times man lusts after the CNN conclave anchor ( Patricia McLaughlin, his red-haired ex- wife ), his imagination sophomoric in a 1950's Playboy way.

Robert Jay Lifton-Greg Mitchell letter on Philip Taubman's August 4 Editorial Notebook on American attitudes toward atomic bombing of Japan ,"Hiroshima remains a raw nerve. An equally hopeful sign was a new opinion poll, which suggested that fully half of all Americans now believe that President Truman should have sought alternatives to dropping the bomb. This reveals that one result of the Smithsonian debacle, and the flood of 50th-anniversary coverage, was to deepen doubts about the official Hiroshima narrative among ordinary Americans. But contrary to Mr. Taubman's report, the Hiroshima Peace Museum now includes an extensive display on Japanese militarism and aggression. There has been a similar shift, limited but significant, in American consciousness toward Hiroshima and its meanings. Despite the inevitable return to business as usual, Americans will no longer resist Hiroshima truths as persistently as before."

Fran Quigley letter rejects Steve Goldsmith's August 4 Op-Ed article expressing enthusiasm for dismantling of Federal welfare system ,"In arguing that Indiana's current system undermines family cohesiveness, Mr. Goldsmith wrongly claims that Indiana residents can not receive A.F.D.C. unless they are unmarried and/or in a different home from their extended family. In fact, both married parents and young parents living with their own families can receive benefits to help support their children. And contrary to Mr. Goldsmith's assertion, Indiana mothers receiving welfare benefits can receive a portion of the child support collected from their children's fathers. It appears that while recent legislation may have finally concluded the treatment of low-income families as political footballs at the national level, those families have been punted to the electoral playing fields of the 50 states."

With 18,000 Amish, Lancaster is second in population only to Holmes County, Ohio, among settlements in the United States.''Roller skates, I never got into them,'' said Amos Stoltzfus, 22.'

If he could give Michelle Smith of Ireland the benefit of doubt, what gave him the right to deprive the Chinese women their privileges to such benefit?After all, none of the doping cases in this Olympics involved a Chinese athlete. Where is the time-honored American principle of'' innocence until proven guilty''? It is very unfortunate a great event in a great nation was so greatly undermined by both Costas and NBC.YONG WEN DENGThe BronxLet the Games End ( and the Controversies, Too )"
Yan Sun letter on Seth Faison's Aug 4 article on Chinese reactions to Atlanta Olympics (S) ,"To the Sports Editor: Seth Faison's article on Chinese reactions to the Olympics ('' The View From China: Red, White and Blue Conspiracy,'' The Times, Aug. 4 ) carried a tone of sneer and mock for the Chinese. I do n't usually make charges of racism, but Faison's article suggests a visible lack of respect for the Chinese. Faison also failed to address the legitimacy of two major Chinese complaints about Atlanta. First, food choices were few and did not agree with Chinese athletes' stomachs. Second, there were three false security alarms in one night in the Chinese dorms. I do n't for a minute believe there was a conspiracy against the Chinese, but the organizers did seem to cut corners and show a lack of cultural sensitivity."
"P J Narayanan letter on bronze medal win by tennis player Leander Paes, sole medalist from India and all of South Asia at Atlanta Olympics (S) ","To the Sports Editor: I would like to join all Indians-- make that all South Asians-- living in this country in thanking Andre Agassi for winning the gold medal in men's singles. South Asia, consisting of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan, is home to over a quarter of humanity but won only a single medal in the Centennial Games. That is one medal more than they won at the last Games and equal to how many medals they won in each of the previous two Games. Leander Paes, the lone medalist, won the bronze medal in men's singles, the event in which Agassi took the gold. But since Andre is an American, the medal ceremony did not escape NBC's attention."

"Japanese computer users have evolved unique set of emoticons, combinations of punctuation, accent marks and letters Westerners orignated to indicate various emotions; Japanese versions are intricate in design, somewhat ambiguous in expression and are right side up instead of sideways; chart (M) ","This is in part because the Japanese language, with its thousands of complex Chinese-based characters known as kanji, is not as keyboard-friendly as English. Some experts familiar with on-line services in both Japan and the United States say the Japanese use the face marks more often than Westerners. This could because the Japanese are used to looking at pictograms, since their written language is based on such characters. Perhaps to avoid offending others, Japanese people rarely use face marks showing anger or sadness. Typing the seemingly intricate Japanese face marks is not as bothersome as it might appear, thanks to Japanese personal computers, which are designed to handle the input of even more intricate Chinese characters. But Japanese computers use two bytes for each character, to allow for enough combinations to represent all the kanji."
Lois Gould letter on furor in Britain over mother's decision to have one child rather than two at time ,"To the Editor: The furor in Britain over a mother's decision to have one child rather than two at a time ( news article, Aug. 6 ) raises the sobering question: Why is there no equivalent furor here over the routine practice in United States hospitals of culling multiple fetuses resulting from widespread use of fertility drugs?Quadruplets and quintuplets have little chance of survival because of low birth weight and attendant vulnerability to perinatal diseases. It is axiomatic that induced multiple-birth pregnancy invites and causes multiple infant deaths, whether at term or through destruction in utero, as a preventive measure to salvage the single or twin survivors. Indeed, the major ethical issue here is whether fetal tissue created by the use of fertility drugs and then harvested as unwanted surplus should be available for research or organ transplants."
Dr Alan Shapiro letter responds to Dr Daniel M Feinberg Aug 5 letter on welfare fraud ,"I have since practiced pediatrics for the past six years in the homeless shelter system and presently as medical director of a community health center in the South Bronx. The'' mild back pains or headaches'' portrayed by Dr. Feinberg as fraudulent claims of welfare beaters are in fact the somatic manifestations found in any population living under stressful conditions. In the community we serve, these symptoms reflect the reality of living in neighborhoods beset by poverty, substandard and overcrowded housing, crime, violence and a severe shortage of services, especially health care. By depicting patients' complaints as deceitful, more profound medical conditions may be missed with potential devastating sequelae. 1996The writer is medical director of the South Bronx Children's Health Center, Montefiore Medical Center."

Yale University Profs Peter H Schuck and Rogers M Smith letter responds to Aug 7 article noting that some Republican platform committee members have cited their 1985 book Citizenship Without Consent in proposing to deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants ,"To the Editor: Our 1985 book,'' Citizenship Without Consent,'' has long been cited by some Republican platform committee members as a source for the committee's proposal to deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants ( news article, Aug. 7 ). We argued that the framers of the Constitution's citizenship clause never addressed the issue of birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants because Federal law did not then limit immigration. We concluded that the clause neither required nor barred birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. On this policy question, we considered arguments on both sides and concluded that eliminating birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants could only be a plausible reform if certain preconditions were met."
Stephen Holden reviews 20th Century R &amp; B: A Musical Celebration at Rainbow and Stars (M) ,"For all the anguished hand-wringing by diehard pop nostalgists decrying the supposed decline of American songwriting in the age of rock, the canon of popular standards keeps growing. Sigler, a 55-year-old singer, songwriter and producer associated with the sleek, propulsive Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970's, proved to be the emotional anchor of Tuesday's opening-night show. As for the debate about one era's standards versus another's, the show perfectly illustrates the artistic tradeoff between the rock and prerock eras. The songs in'' 20th-Century R & amp; B'' may lack the literary refinement of earlier standards, but they have the rough-and-tumble immediacy of music describing life as it's lived, not as it's dreamed."

Like many classical artists, even those more naturally steeped in the jazz and dance styles Bernstein drew from, Mr. Masur's shortcoming was his approach to rhythm. When they turn to jazz-influenced styles, they assume that rhythmic swing means rhythmic freedom. Yet, the essential quality of the jazz style is not freedom but rhythmic relaxation. The playing of great jazz artists is precise yet relaxed, a wondrous combination. For all of Mr. Masur's efforts at projecting Bernstein's jazz riffs and cha-cha patterns with bounce and verve, the playing was stiff."

Jeffrey Merrill letter responds to Aug 6 article on rising health costs in Europe ,"Since all of the countries you discuss rely on personal income-based mechanisms to finance their health care systems, poor economic performance and higher unemployment have limited the available funds. Rather than suggesting that the European health care system is bloated, we might better characterize the problem as one of shrinking coffers. The risks of reducing needed care and of creating distrust between patients and their physicians may be more real than any reductions in health care spending. This is particularly so in European countries, where there are already health care spending caps and other explicit ways of containing costs. Managed care may be an American export with more glamour than real utility to other health care systems. 1996The writer is a visiting professor of health care management at the Columbia University School of Public Health."

The Piltdown hoax in 1912 involved a fake fossil skull of an ape-like human, and it was the most famous of many historical scientific deceptions.

Editorial contends that high-level diplomatic pressure by US and European Union has prevented breakdown of peace efforts in Bosnian city of Mostar; maintains that lesson to be learned from furor over recent elections in Mostar is that major powers supervising national voting in Bosnia must do more than monitor campaign and voting arrangements; asserts that they must be prepared to lean on region's power brokers with aggressive diplomacy and threat of economic punishment to insure that all parties comply with election results (M) ,"The voting in Mostar was Bosnia's first since the end of the war. The bitter wrangling it set off between two supposedly allied ethnic groups offers a grim preview of similar battles likely to break out after Bosnia's national elections.

Kemp? Jack Kemp's a good person and he gets across to more people,'' said Mr. James, vice president of a union local at Republic Engineered Steels. Kemp sticks with things,'' he said.''

"Divers recover last of four luggage containers that Trans World Airlines Flight 800 was carrying in its forward cargo hold; investigators say that like others, it shows no visible evidence of damage from bomb; finding throws serious doubt into leading theory of investigators, that jetliner was brought down by bomb secreted in passengers' luggage; drawing; photo (M) ","Tonight, a senior investigator said:'' I think it potentially closes out one area where the bomb might have been. They were situated in the front of the hold, and no other cargo was in the hold, investigators said. As early as the middle part of last week, several key investigators began having doubts that a bomb had been hidden in luggage in the cargo hold because of the condition of the other three aluminum baggage bins, which had been recovered early last week. But bomb experts looking at those containers did not find any residue or damage consistent with a bomb, investigators said."
Joseph R Abrahamson letter contends that Republican Party's pro-life stand insures its defeat in Nov ,"The conservatives who have control of the convention apparently think that because the G.O.P.'s pro- life stand did n't preclude its landslide Presidential victories in 1980, 1984 and 1988, it is still possible to have a pro-life plank and avoid defeat this year. He issued his decree preventing Federal financing for vital medical research using fetal tissue. Suddenly people like me, who in a 50-year involvement with American politics had never voted anything but a straight Republican ticket, woke up to the fact that the comedians were in control. Republicans seem not to notice that George Bush lost the 1992 election ( incidentally, the election in which I cast my first vote for a Democrat).JOSEPH R. ABRAHAMSON San Diego, Aug. 8, 1996G.O.P."
Chris Crobaugh letter responds to Anthony Lewis Aug 9 Op-Ed column on revival of religion in politics ,"What is true is that there is a wave of sentiment to return morals to politics. Morals are by definition inextricably connected to religion. Our political and social systems are reaping the rewards of liberals like Mr. Lewis having removed religion and morals from the public policy arena. We tried liberal solutions for more than 60 years, and they have brought us a permanent and widening underclass, a wave of juvenile violence that unsettles us, a significant portion of our citizenry that is dependent on government for basic survival and a political system that requires winning at any cost. Lewis would better serve his country and his readers if he would more closely analyze why so many Americans are ready to return some sort of moral code to public policy forums."

"Bob Dole and his running mate, Jack Kemp, arrive in San Diego for Republican convention; Dole attacks Pres Clinton in speech that signals bruising fall campaign in which Republicans will appeal to anxiety of middle-class voters; Patrick J Buchanan, at rally near Escondido, proclaims 'truce of San Diego,' but does not endorse Dole; Kemp criticizes Clinton for opposing Dole's plan to cut taxes and balance budget; photo (M) ","He repeatedly invoked Ronald Reagan, the last Republican who rode to the White House on a promise of tax cuts.''It's time to lift up America,'' Mr. Dole said.'' And that's exactly what Jack Kemp Rather than praise Mr. Dole, Mr. Buchanan devoted his speech to ridiculing Mr. Clinton.

Still, the loquacious Mr. Kemp also came close to upstaging the leading candidate on the ticket: he spoke for only three minutes less than Mr. Dole."
"Patrick J Buchanan, declaring temporary truce with Republican Party, ends his wilted Presidential campaign for 1996 with speech that seemed to launch his campaign for year 2000; Buchanan, in his speech to about 1,000 supporters in Escondido, Calif, stops well short of endorsing Republican ticket of Bob Dole and Jack Kemp (M) ","Mr. Buchanan forswore a third-party candidacy but stopped well short of endorsing Bob Dole, the presumed Republican nominee. In his speech to about 1,000 supporters gathered in Escondido, north of here, Mr. Buchanan mentioned Mr. Dole only once, in a somewhat poignant reprise of the campaign's might-have-beens.'' What we need is a fighting second party. While he called for party unity, Mr. Buchanan did not try to rally his supporters to Mr. Dole's banner. Before Mr. Buchanan spoke, Oliver North addressed the cheering crowd, urging them not to desert the Republican Party. While Mr. Kemp and Mr. Buchanan both oppose abortion rights, they disagree sharply on trade, immigration and other issues. since the party's spoiler in one election would make an unlikely nominee in the next.''"

There were only scattered pockets of detractors, unlike at the Puerto Rican Day Parade in early June, where the Mayor was continuously booed and heckled.
