"Aiwa Co, electronics maker that was pioneer in moving manufacturing out of Japan in search of lower costs, plans to bring part of production back to Japan from Malaysia and other Asian nations; cites drop in value of yen and strategic factors (M) ","The decision by Aiwa is striking because the company was one of the earliest and most aggressive of Japanese companies in moving its manufacturing out of Japan in search of lower costs in the late 1980's. About 90 percent of the company's production is now outside its home country. But Aiwa said it would now shift some production of small tabletop stereos, its best-known product, back to Japan. One reason is that many Japanese companies, partly in response to the sharp rise of the yen that began in 1993, have been moving production offshore. Other Japanese companies have also recently began focusing more on domestic production."

"City of San Diego reaches draft agreement to buy several billion gallons of water from new source, namely, farmers in Imperial Valley who are beyond reach of Metropolitan Water District, Los Angeles-based government monopoly; city leaders characterize move as prudent step to diversify water supply in drought-prone region, but most Californians recognize it as brash assertion of independence; ever since World War II, San Diego has chafed at being almost completely dependent for fresh water on regional monopoly largely controlled by nemesis, Los Angeles; map; photo (M) ","City leaders characterized the move as a prudent step to diversify the water supply in this drought-prone region. Water is the basis of economics here. So the water district is playing hardball. Constructing a new aqueduct to the valley, which gets its water from the Colorado River, would cost San Diego up to $ 3.5 billion and take, perhaps, 15 years.

The deal's proponents in the valley argue that the water sold to San Diego would be made available through conservation. In this country, you just do n't rush when water is involved.''"

Yesterday's ruling, in a case involving a 15-year-old girl who attacked another youth with a box-cutter, raises the standard for committing children to the same'' dangerousness'' level as the standard for adults.'' Psychiatric commitment is an extreme and extraordinary measure,'' said Lily DeYoung of the State Public Defender's office.' ' We need to make sure that it is used only as a last resort, and this ruling helps insure that.''NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING"

These proposals were implemented by the last two Republican Administrations, which ran on the same platform and instituted censorship of family planning providers in the United States and abroad. Although litigation and Congressional action prevented the Title X'' gag rule'' from taking effect, the Supreme Court decision that found the measure constitutional has forever undermined free speech rights.

"Analysis: Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole repositioned his campaign with unveiling of economic plan, seeking to present himself as candidate of middle class; speech in Chicago was tailored to appeal to voters his advisers concluded he needs to defeat Pres Clinton, namely, suburban residents and women; sounded much like Bill Clinton of 1992, presenting himself as agent of change, defender of middle class and candidate who understands troubles of working women in today's economy (M) ","Its reduction in the capital gains tax from a top rate of 28 percent to 14 percent will cost $ 13 billion, the plan said. To offset the $ 548 billion cost of the tax cuts over six years, the plan assumes that the combination of lower taxes and less regulation of business will generate faster economic growth, increasing tax revenue by $ 147 billion over the period. The plan proposes a combination of spending cuts and revenue increases of $ 217 billion. But the Dole plan left many analysts questioning the economic and political assumptions underlying it. While most economists accept that tax cuts generate some'' feedback,'' there are no generally accepted models for how a broad-based program such as Mr. Dole's would improve economic growth.''"
"Democrats are anything but nonchalant in drive to undermine Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole's economic plan, whose centerpiece is 15 percent tax cut; even though they insist that plan is irresponsible and will never take hold with American public, they concede that notion of tax cut has innate appeal, one which they are determined to shatter (M) ","And to the extent that the Dole campaign is trying to put Democrats in a corner to react, to say that we're not for tax cuts, is a potential problem.'' Clinton himself is well aware of the appeal of tax cuts. Cutting the Federal income tax by 15 percent was'' the right thing for the country'' Still, the 15 percent tax cut was attractive to a minority of independents and Democrats, and that could win votes for Mr. Dole. By 65 percent to 29 percent, the public preferred maintaining current spending on education to cutting taxes. wage.''The advertisement refers to Mr. Clinton's modest plans for'' tax cuts for families,'' and for college tuition tax credits and for health insurance that people can take from job to job.''"
"Bob Dole's Presidential campaign strategists, facing pressure from anti-abortion forces within the Republican Party, relent and embrace platform plank that not only continues to call for constitutional amendment to outlaw all abortion, but also makes no specific concession to party members on opposing side of issue; photo (M) ","The 25 are members of the individual rights subcommittee of the Platform Committee and are charged with writing the sections on abortion, immigration, affirmative action, gun control and several other controversial issues. The abortion plank that the Dole camp accepted-- and that the subcommittee adopted, with only four dissenting votes-- is essentially the same one that has been in the party's platform for 20 years. But abortion opponents rebelled, and Mr. Dole backtracked somewhat. But on the opposing side, two of the most prominent Republican governors, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Weld, have said they will press for a full-scale abortion rights plank. Abortion has been a thorny issue for Mr. Dole."
"Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole unveils long-awaited economic plan he hopes will breathe new life into Presidential campaign; calls for $548 billion in tax cuts and $500-per-child tax credit, and balancing of Federal budget in five years; adopts supply-side economics championed by Ronald Reagan, which he has criticized in past, while trying to appeal to besieged middle class; pledges to cut taxes 15 percent across-the-board, and says he can still balance Federal budget by year 2002; says cutting taxes and balancing budget are matter of Presidential will; promises to reign in Internal Revenue Service, ending 'KGB-like audits,' privatizing many of its functions and eliminating filing for 40 million low- and middle-income taxpayers; calls for one-year tax amnesty; Pres Clinton says Dole plan would weaken economy and hurt American people; aides, worried over political appeal of Dole's message, say Clinton may propose more tax cuts (M) ","Dole said his plan would cut the Federal income tax bill of a family of four making $ 35,000 a year by 56 percent-- for a savings of $ 1,371 over what it pays now. Most of that would come from a proposed $ 500 tax credit for each child under 18.President Clinton said Mr. Dole's plan would weaken the economy and hurt the American people.' Dole emphasized that although he had built his reputation in Congress as a deficit hawk, he was embracing tax cuts with equal fervor.'' Growth advocates say tax cuts first. Dole's plan also includes cutting the top rate of the capital gains tax by half, to 14 percent, and expanding Individual Retirement Accounts. The plan also calls for a one-year tax amnesty."
"Article examines Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole's economic plan, which promises to bring tax relief to Americans; notes Federal tax burden has been remarkably steady going back three decades through Democratic and Republican Administrations; since mid-1960's, revenue from Federal taxes has never fallen below 17.2 percent nor risen higher than 19.7 percent; if Dole's proposals became law, they are unlikely to break bounds (M) ","When one tax goes down, another goes up. That is $ 1.4 trillion of the $ 7.4 trillion in G.D.P, with nearly half of those taxes coming from individual income taxes. Most of the reduction would come through a 15-percent cut in income tax rates and a $ 500 tax credit for each child under 18 years of age. Still, if Federal taxes have remained a steady portion of national income, the mix has changed drastically. The 1986 tax bill brought another cut in the top rate, to 28 percent, although more income could be taxed. And in 1990 and 1993, Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton gradually raised the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent for individuals."

"Analysis: while Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole argues that his very standing as nation's fiscal conscience imbues his economic plan, which calls for sweeping tax cuts, with credibility, many economists and budget analysts who have looked at his statistics are less impressed (M) ","Dole's economic plan and its presentation reflected several political calculations. In settling on a 15 percent across-the-board tax cut, as opposed to a more selective repeal of the 1993 tax increase, Mr. Dole's aides were hoping to guard against attacks from the Clinton campaign that the tax cut favored the rich. That is the tax that is, fairly or not, usually associated with upper-income voters. In one recent poll, Mr. Hart said, given a choice between reducing the deficit-- which Mr. Clinton made a priority, at the cost of going back on a 1992 promise of a middle-class tax cut-- and cutting taxes, voters overwhelmingly chose reducing the deficit."

"Richard Vetter, entomologist at University of California, and two other entomologists, Drs P Kirk Visscher and Scott Camazine, take issue with time-honored advice for taking care of bee stings, namely to scrape or tease stinger out of the skin carefully with edge of knife blade or credit card and never to pinch, pluck or grab it; three men, in study published in current issue of The Lancet, British medical journal, say it seems to them that speed matters more that style in removing stingers; sketch of honeybee's sting mechanism (M) ","He and his colleagues reasoned that if a person could pluck out the stinger before all the venom was pumped out of the sac, a smaller, less painful welt might result. Next, the team wanted to find out whether the amount of time it took to remove a stinger would affect the size of the welt. When it was left in place for eight seconds, the resulting welt was a third larger than it was when the stinger was removed after one second. Just pull out the stinger as fast as you can. Even then, the sting will still hurt, and a welt will form."
"Jon Pareles reviews performances by two Punjabi rock bands from Birmingham, England: Safri Boys and DCS, presented by Central Park Summerstage; photo (M) ","And on Monday night at Wetlands, Najma sang blithely eclectic songs by the Indian film composer S. D. Burman. Yet their lyrics were in Punjabi, their tunes used the scales and inflections of Indian music, and their rhythms were fired up with the high-speed salvos of traditional drumming. Then most songs settled into mid-tempo grooves, carrying reedy, impassioned lead vocals that rose with the microtonal curls and slides of Indian tradition. Its songs leaped from vocal improvisations without a beat to reggae to disco to galloping Punjabi rhythms to spiraling lead guitar solos. The backup group, led by Chris Rael, an American student of Indian music, echoed flamenco, the Allman Brothers and the world-jazz group Oregon."

Clinton's market-based strategy marked a historic departure from his party's usual economic approach. Every single Republican leader in Congress predicted the Clinton plan would ruin the economy. Should n't you have dusted off quotes from Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich or that former economics professor, Dick Armey?Instead of admitting its mistakes, the G.O.P. is now choosing to complain about inadequate growth. Whatever other failings his Administration might have, it is more than fair for President Clinton to take credit for the solid economic performance since 1993, especially when it's so clearly traceable to his plan."

Gergiyev, checking his watch repeatedly, started skipping over pages here and there, and finally cut the work off well before the end, some two and a half hours into the session. The Kirov players undoubtedly had the sound of Avery Fisher Hall firmly, perhaps irrevocably, planted in their ears by the time they left New York."

Editorial lauds New York State Legislature for taking responsible steps to restructure preschool education program for handicapped children (M) ,"New York's Governor and State Legislature, though often incapable of working together on the most innocuous of issues, have quietly agreed to make dramatic changes in the sensitive matter of preschool education for handicapped children. The state provides special education for handicapped preschoolers under the reasonable theory that early intervention may improve a youngster's chances of thriving in school later. Unlike most states, New York leaves preschool special education to private providers instead of public schools. As a result, the preschool special education program has evolved into a peculiar system in which the providers serve three different functions that inevitably spawn conflicts of interest. The state believes that many children who are in full-time rehabilitative programs could actually be treated by visiting therapists who are much less expensive."

Investigators continue to explore prevailing theory that downfall of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 was caused by bomb; they are concerned that extended submersion in salt water might have effect on telltale chemical traces that bomb would have left on debris (M) ,"Your explosive residue,'' he said,'' adheres to all sorts of materials-- to carpet fibers and upholstery and plastics, and it can be trapped in the surface material through all sorts of means. And if a bomb was the cause, the explosive material could have been one of several kinds. And depending on the kind of explosive, ocean water could either wash away the chemical residue or have little effect. Oxley, who is a consultant to the F.B.I. and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said that investigators undoubtedly are rinsing airplane parts with an organic solvent to see if there is organic material that would not normally be present.'' There are explosive materials that could have been used that are water soluble."

But this obscures one minor detail: the flat tax does not treat all income the same. It taxes only salaries and leaves investment income untouched. If a C.E.O. makes $ 300,000, she would get taxed at 20 percent, or whatever the flat rate happened to be. But if she happened to prefer that $ 300,000 in stock options, then it would not be taxed at all. Or consider the capital gains tax. Income from capital gains is taxed at a lower rate than income from, say, interest. A real tax reformer would want to tax all that income the same. But cutting the capital gains tax is an obsession with Republicans."

Dole had not asked for much from the religious right.

Poor Bob Dole is cursed with the knowledge that he is being measured by the quieter and more numerous independents and mainstream Republicans. Now he has topped that with an abortion position he did not want."

Peter Passell Economic Scene article on new welfare reform law; notes it fails to provide extra money to wean millions off welfare and instead sharply cuts budget for major assistance programs; questions whether states and localities will act to ease most dolorous consequences; drawing (M) ,"To Congressional Republicans, the new welfare law is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a 60-year-old system that does not work. To many welfare experts outside the political rough and tumble, it appears to be both. The political resolution to that conflict is welfare reform on the cheap.'' New-fashioned liberals, led by Senator Moynihan, distanced themselves from those on the traditional left who thought welfare ought to be a no-questions-asked minimum income for families. Note, too, that states will also be required to maintain their own spending on welfare at at least three-quarters of the 1994 level. But there is no escaping the fact that this is welfare reform on a shoestring."

History has shown that lower tax rates produce higher tax revenues. But the tax'' bonus'' that Mr. Dole claims for his proposals would be helped by something else as well. With Republicans in control of both the White House and Congress, we can begin to attack the network of burdensome regulations and mandates that impose such a massive indirect'' tax'' on this country's economic vigor."
Mike Glass letter comments on Bob Dole's tax-cut proposals (S) ,"To the Editor: My understanding of supply-side theory is that lower taxes lead to higher levels of investment, resulting in bountiful economic growth that overcomes the budget deficit. Every dollar in lost revenue from Bob Dole's proposals for reducing tax rates and offering tax credits for children needs to be replaced with a dollar from the proceeds of Government bond sales. The same ca n't be said about the increased take-home pay from the tax cuts-- leading to precisely the opposite of the intended result.

Angel Bob Dole is pleading for the former Senator to stick to the principles he has espoused, virtually without variation since 1980, favoring deficit reduction over drastic tax cuts to spur economic growth. Devil Bob Dole is reminding Mr. Dole of his failed campaigns of 1980 and 1988, prodding him with a tiny pitchfork to disregard his principles so he may win the White House.

It might be argued that the actual Basquiat, the 80's graffiti artist and tragic supernova, is almost a secondary concern anyway.'' Basquiat'' regards its main character as a pawn within the wheeler-dealer atmosphere of the 80's art world, and a fresh, naive talent whose abilities were exploited on all sides. Dennis Hopper ( as Bruno Bischofberger ), Elina Lowensohn ( as Annina Nosei ) and Parker Posey ( as Mary Boone ) play the dealers capitalizing on Basquiat's boldly attention-getting art and exploiting his novelty value as a young black star in SoHo."
Ruth Reichl briefly reviews Manhattan restaurant Coco Pazzo Teatro (S) ,"In my imagination, the glass filled with chunks of fresh watermelon and layered with panna cotta and magenta watermelon sorbet and granita grows even larger than it actually is. The pale green fronds of candied watermelon rind stretch out, too. But then the new Coco Pazzo Teatro is not exactly an Italian restaurant. Pino Luongo, the owner, has set out to capture the trendy set in his latest venture, this one at the Paramount Hotel, and he has laced the menu with dishes like Caesar salad with grilled chicken breast and double cut pork chop with apple-bacon chutney. As the crowd munches, the maitre d'hotel wanders about the colorful room, kissing air, adjusting his bow tie and discussing the weather in three languages. So are the herb-dusted Tuscan fries and the giant Florentine steak."

One can not underestimate the deep moral importance of the intellectual and character virtues instilled when we do our centuries-old job right. So, too, when one works to create an effective residential community among a diverse group of students, one also works to nurture such virtues as mutual understanding, civility and cooperation. Moral education is embedded in the definition of what we have always been committed to do."

"Editorial on task facing Russian Pres Boris N Yeltsin, set to begin second term; urges him to be candid about his ill health; urges quick settlement of Chechen secession crisis and continuation of economic reforms (M) ","With his health in doubt, the war in Chechnya flaring and the Russian economy at a critical juncture, Boris Yeltsin begins his second term as President today with diminished expectations. But Mr. Yeltsin and his countrymen can still move ahead with economic and political reform if the second Yeltsin administration is more disciplined and consistent than the first. The first step should be candor about Mr. Yeltsin's health. The conflict has already cost 30,000 lives and depleted the Russian treasury and Mr. Yeltsin's credibility. Chernomyrdin and Anatoly Chubais, Mr. Yeltsin's new chief of staff, are committed to reform."
"Editorial on terrifying financial implications of Federal welfare bill for New York State and New York City, which will have to pay for work programs and day care; urges state and city lawmakers to avoid drastic response too soon (M) ","New York officials initially feared that the Federal Government was planning to dump all the costs of health care for legal immigrants on the states right away. But the financial implications of the welfare bill are still terrifying. New York, under its State Constitution, is required to give aid to its needy citizens. But in order to keep qualifying for what Federal welfare money is still available, the state and city will have to prove that recipients are working for their benefits. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani estimated that all in all, the bill could wind up costing New York City an additional $ 720 million a year. Ideally, New York should spend the rest of this year studying the new welfare law, collecting data and coming up with contingency plans."
"Editorial on eerie experience of driving across desert on Interstate highway from Salt Lake City to Wendover, Nev, in heavy, salt-laden wind (S) ","It is just 116 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Wendover, Nev., on Interstate 80. Perhaps half the distance lies across the Great Salt Lake Desert-- the salt flats. Some days it takes less time to drive from Salt Lake to Wendover than from Houston Street to the Tappan Zee Bridge. Nearing the salt desert, the Interstate seemed to disappear into an enormous bank of ground fog welling up from the south. The fog was, in fact, a great cloud of salt blowing horizontally across the desert, a saline blizzard on a summer's day. The sun disappeared overhead, and yet the air retained a peculiar, wintry brightness, diffused by the salt beds and by the salt in the wind."

Nowhere is this more true than in the competitive discount store sector, which depends heavily on Sunday newspaper circulars to draw customer traffic. They see that if they devote three-quarters of a page to a shirt, they can expect more productivity out of one item.''Indeed, instead of featuring cluttered pages covered with a mishmash of socks, rakes and shampoo, circular pages now tend to focus on just a few related items, with the prices in bold print.

But tax avoidance appears to be the reason for structuring the family company transactions. But under the tax law, because the Simplot company will not complete the sale until 2003, it will not owe capital gains taxes until then. Perhaps he just used the profits to buy more Micron shares; perhaps he used them to buy shares in other companies. Now that he has sold, it appears that Mr. Simplot will have to pay capital gains taxes, unlike the family concern."

A missile. Those facts are most simply explained by the theory that a bomb exploded on the plane. In the absence of definitive proof of a bomb, other theories continue to draw attention from investigators. With the exception of an Iranian Air Force cargo plane that exploded near Madrid in 1976, there is no record of such explosions in 747's. There is also the theory that a leaking fuel pump touched off a catastrophic explosion. But the missile theory is problematic. The finding bolstered the theory that a bomb, secreted in the forward cargo hold, first knocked out luggage and part of the bottom of the plane, even before the plane's front section became severed by the blast's force."

People who inherit two copies of the mutant CKR-5 gene, one from each parent, can not make the protein. So if a sex partner transmits H.I.V. to them, the virus can not dock with a molecule on the surface of the CD-4 immune cells. Thus, H.I.V.-1 remains harmless in those people. The Aaron Diamond team predicted that further studies would show that 1 percent of people of Western European heritage carry a double dose of the mutant gene. Most H.I.V-infected people develop AIDS within 10 years. Parmentier's team also did studies to determine how often people had one dose of the gene."

Batterers who break restraining orders by stalking or harassing their victims can now be charged with felonies. Typically, a victim would ask a Family Court judge to order the abuser to stay away.

Often, abusers are not in court when a judge issues a protective order, in which case police officers must serve them in person. For abusers who have appeared in court and heard the judge directly order them to stay away from a victim, the new law stiffens penalties for their violations under the theory that they have flagrantly disobeyed the judge."

Her work, by the way, was done at the Kohler-financed John Michael Kohler Arts Center, whose Arts / Industry program encourages a'' dialogue'' between those strange bedfellows, art and industry."

We parked in lots within five-minute walks of every venue. We marveled at the organization of the police and enthusiasm of the volunteers we encountered, many of whom were dedicated business people on loan from their corporations. The free market performed in a superior manner in Atlanta, as hundreds of thousands of visitors will attest. JUSTIN ISRAELNew York, Aug. 5, 1996"

John Weitz letter on Aug 5 article on women's new attitude toward fashion; drawing (S) ,"The whole American look, loosely called'' only'' sportswear, was trashed in the 1960's when a clique of journalists, stylists, fashion directors, copyists and photographers took control. But because European designers did not and could not understand modern American life, the wrong messages came back via these American fashion prattlers. This contributed to the eventual bankruptcies of several department store groups that were presenting fashion ideas American women would not accept. I stopped designing women's fashion in 1964 when I realized the American fashion business did not give a hoot about what was going on under its nose. If you really want to see American fashion at its best, go to Europe. European women love the casual American look."

As it is, the fashion industry is alive and well, and it is curious that you should choose this moment to suggest otherwise. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, the fashion industry suffered serious setbacks, as did virtually every other industry in the country. For example, while Sharon Stone did wear a black Gap turtleneck to the Oscars this year, she wore a Giorgio Armani evening coat over that turtleneck-- a detail you chose to omit."

As long as untreated sewage and agricultural runoff are allowed to flow into Lake Victoria, all attempts to stop the proliferation of the water hyacinth will be futile.

Here was a horse who did n't race anywhere until he was 3 years old, who missed the Kentucky Derby and the races that can make you famous, who was 2 for 13 at the start of his career-- and who is 16 for 16 at the close of his career.

Editorial says series in The Times on women's fashions documented demise of designers who have long made clothes for mythical creatures who are impossibly tall and thin and carry fat wallets (M) ,"How many women have donned the latest fashion trend only to meet with snickers that it looks outrageous or inappropriate on them? Such women have long been victimized by designers who make clothes for mythical creatures who are impossibly tall and thin and carry fat wallets. Smart, stylish women have always adjusted the latest styles to their own advantage. At the same time, office dress codes have relaxed, and many women want to spend less time and money on clothes, preferring fitness centers, adventure trips or charity work. Many designers and retailers are dropping their costliest lines. But those fashion houses that try to stuff women into unflattering, impractical outfits are becoming fashion victims themselves."

"Editorial says Bob Dole's reported selection of Jack Kemp as running mate is not a dumb choice; says Kemp is just enough of an original thinker to give Democrats something to worry about, although his independent turn of mind may also cause Dole anxious moments; says Dole has chosen to set past differences aside to strengthen his ticket with someone of Presidential caliber himself (M) ","He could not get Colin Powell, and he apparently felt that neither the new-generation Midwestern Governors like John Engler nor the low-recognition Senators like Connie Mack and John McCain could help him close President Clinton's 20-point lead.

"Editorial applauds Securities and Exchange Commission, which censured Nasdaq for failing to monitor sales practices or stop collusive behavior, and negotiated settlement that commits dealers to weed out sleazy practices that have cost investors millions of dollars in past; says capital markets can function well only if investors are confident that they are being treated fairly (M) ","The S.E.C., citing tape recordings and other condemning evidence, accused Nasdaq dealers of colluding to force investors to buy shares at artificially high prices and sell shares at artificially low prices. The wide spread between these buy and sell prices produced huge profits-- perhaps totaling billions of dollars-- for the dealers at the expense of investors. The commission also accused dealers of reneging on offers to trade posted prices and other unprofessional practices. The S.E.C. took its first step to end cozy dealer-driven practices when it recently pressured the association to split off its regulatory function from its profit-making function. This might require dealers to display all offers made by investors. But capital markets can function well only if investors are confident that they are being treated fairly."
