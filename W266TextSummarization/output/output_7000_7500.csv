However, he improperly characterizes the inquiry employed by the courts when analyzing First Amendment establishment clause cases. The most important question courts would ask is whether the government practice has the effect of endorsing religious education, not whether the program was intended to benefit the religious schools.

If only Congress would curb legal immigration or increase school funds, all problems would be solved. But the entire nation faces a school overcrowding crisis.

Dollar for dollar, New York already has significantly more debt than any other state. Under the currently proposed bond act, the new debt would be even more burdensome.

The Governor proposes to pay for the bond act with roughly half of the revenues from the state's real-property transfer tax, amounting to $ 100 million annually. That would double the amount provided annually by the bond, without the burdensome debt.

Lawrence B Johnson reviews some recent recordings of music by Shostakovich; photos (M) ,"THE TORMENTED AND compelling physiognomy of Shostakovich's symphonic works might be roughly traced by connecting the dots of major essays from his precocious maturity to his middle years-- from the youthful bravura of the First Symphony to the humanistic questioning of the Fourth and the world-weary testimony of the Eighth. Seven decades later, the symphony still inspires awe as the work of a teen-ager, and it has remained one of Shostakovich's most performed-- and recorded-- works. In the following months, he finished work on his Fourth Symphony while keeping a wary eye on the political skies. In any case, the three-movement, hourlong Fourth Symphony really was a watershed. Here, perhaps more than in the case of the Fourth Symphony, one senses Shostakovich's frustration."

Lee the Soldier'' deals not with those years but with Lee the general during the four years of the Civil War, especially the last three, when he commanded the Army of Northern Virginia. What might Lee have done differently? Lee believed that time was not on the Confederacy's side. Thus, the argument runs, Lee helped to defeat the Confederacy. The best statement of the case in'' Lee the Soldier'' is an essay by a Union veteran of the Civil War, George A. Bruce. Lee thought much about what historians would say. Lee the Soldier'' continues those controversies."
"Gerald Jonas reviews books The Ringworld Throne by Larry Niven, Blameless In Abaddon by James Morrow and Rider At the Gate and Cloud's Rider by C J Cherryh (L) ","Science fiction novels, like detective novels, tend to beget sequels, which, if successful, beget long-running series. Readers who remember Ringworld from earlier encounters will no doubt relish the latest installment of the saga. Of course, by manifesting the 80-million-ton Divine Body, the author forestalls any argument that finds the existence of evil sufficient grounds for doubting the existence of God. The plot of the two books, which actually form one seamless narrative, concerns the testing of a young rider named Danny Fisher, his fateful encounter with an older rider named Guil Stuart, the appearance of a rogue horse whose disjointed sendings can drive entire villages to madness and death, and the discovery of an even more frightening adversary in the sparsely populated High Wild."
"James Sheehan reviews book The Logic of Evil: The Social Origins of the Nazi Party, 1925-1933 by William Brustein (L) ","The Social Origins of the Nazi Party, 1925- 1933. Mr. Brustein, a professor of sociology at the University of Minnesota, believes that political behavior is based on people's rational calculation of their economic self-interest. Through a sophisticated set of classifications and statistical analyses, Mr. Brustein concludes that Nazism was overrepresented among those occupational groups to which its economic program most actively appealed: small-business men and farmers, married male white-collar employees, industrial workers in import-oriented enterprises and skilled blue-collar workers. Many Social Democratic and, particularly, Center voters had economic interests quite like the groups overrepresented in Mr. Brustein's sample. Mr. Brustein is probably right ( and Mr. Goldhagen wrong ) that before 1933 anti-Semitism was not particularly important for many Nazi voters and even for some party members."

Maggie Garb reviews book Big Picture: Stories by Percival Everett (S) ,"By Percival Everett. Graywolf, paper, $ 12.95.Filled with an unlikely assemblage of cowboys and painters, veterans and veterinarians, the stories in Percival Everett's latest book chart the inexplicable moments when life takes unexpected turns.

In another story, the disappearance of a pair of false teeth fosters a subtle alteration in the lives of two longtime friends. In depicting such characters, Mr. Everett uses a laconic style that sometimes seems to work against his characters' eccentricities, but at others it feels perfectly apt, giving them a strangely appealing complexity."

Letter by Michael Morris on William Julius Wilson's Aug 18 article on unemployment and its impact on inner-cities (S) ,"William Julius Wilson's article'' Work'' ( Aug. 18 ) reminded me of Belfast and Londonderry, Northern Ireland. When I was there in the 1980's, I saw entire neighborhoods that had no adult male role models who went off to work in the morning. In one house, a grandfather, father and teen-age son lived together, and none had ever held a steady job. The families there were all white, and the prejudice that drove the problem was religious. The situation your article so powerfully depicted has little to do with the color of a person's skin and much to do with the psychic and emotional damage that lack of economic opportunity inflicts.

"Robert H Stern letter comments on Bernard Holland's Sept 1 article Music By Proxy, or Rather, Several ","To the Editor: It appears that quantum mechanics, rather than the mechanics of the reproducing piano, have influenced Bernard Holland's review of new CD recordings of this fascinating piece of lost craftsmanship $ ('' Music By Proxy, or Rather, Several,'' Sept. 1 $ ). Holland's opus on the Duo-Art reproducing grand was certainly compromised by his knowledge that the recording was of a recording. As the owner of a restored 1923 Chickering baby grand piano with an Ampico mechanism ( similar to the Duo-Art ), I can attest to the verisimilitude of the reproducing grand. The biggest problem with the Ampico and Duo-Art is not a lack of subtle dynamic range but rather that it is almost impossible to find technicians who understand their complex mechanisms well enough to keep them in repair."
Stephen L Bayne letter on Bernard Holland's article on credibility of reproducing piano rolls ,"To the Editor: Mr. Holland's queries about the credibility of reproducing piano rolls are answered easily. A simple comparison of the playing of pianists like Busoni, Hofmann, Friedman and Bauer on Duo-Art rolls versus their playing on acoustic 78 rpm records ( in decent condition, played on modern equipment ) makes it clear that the piano rolls are inadequate, misleading and frequently downright weird. Like one of Mr. Holland's predecessors, Harold Schonberg, I find the early 78's to have a realistic and natural piano sound frequently lacking in today's highly engineered CD's. The'' golden age'' piano greats did sound great on the 78's. The Duo-Art rolls, however, do them a pitiable disservice. STEPHEN L. BAYNE SeattleREPRODUCING PIANOS"

Thus, school spending is equalized in rich and poor districts. But more than half of the state's school districts, particularly wealthy suburban districts in the northern part of the state, spend much more than what the Whitman administration says is necessary and offer more programs, like advanced-placement courses, that many parents do not want to give up."

Compost, the topmost ingredient to add to any new planting area, will improve the water-holding qualities of the soil and provide needed nutrients. Then be sure to water the new plantings well.

It may take some time for the lawn seed to germinate, but fill in it will. Although many traditionalists insist on a spring feeding, too, more and more lawn professionals prefer late-fall feeding only. When spring comes, the nutrients will be broken down and leached down deeply into the root zones to support new growth."

Photos of certain trendy Manhattan males with plunging necklines ,"Plunging necklines for men, associated with the hot designer Tom Ford for Gucci, may remind some people of the unbuttoned sports shirts worn without jackets by Hollywood's Rat Pack in the 1950's and 60's. Today, the shirts are dress shirts, and the collars usually spread like wings over black suit jackets for day and evening. Necklines have long been a focus of women's fashion ( left ). The men's plunge, though still timid compared to women's, reflects the interest in men's wear as fashion.

"Study by Liberty Financial Companies suggests that small stocks may have better chance of shining if Pres Clinton is re-elected, while big stocks may do better if Bob Dole wins; graph showing average annual returns of small stocks under Democratic and Republican Presidents since 1937 (S) ","But the study's findings on small stocks run counter to the common notion that policies of Democratic Presidents can hurt business and put a damper on the stock market. The study analyzed the gains of small stocks during Republican and Democratic administrations beginning in 1929. Market capitalizations of these stocks range from $ 86 million to $ 171 million. Since the start of the Hoover Administration in 1929, small stocks have risen 22.8 percent a year, on average, during the nine terms of Democratic Presidents and just 1.9 percent during the eight Republican terms.

Anthony A Cupaiuolo letter says that before Japan's welfare system is considered for US it is well to remember disparity in wealth and education systems in US ,"To the Editor: Before your Sept. 10 front-page overview of the Japanese welfare system is used to support the new Federal welfare legislation in this country with its reduced benefits, let us keep in mind the differences between our two societies. Aside from those your article mentions is the most important difference: Japan does not have the wide disparity of the United States in the wealth and quality of its school systems. All Japanese children receive a solid education. Japanese officials who study at Pace University never cease to wonder at why neighboring school districts in Westchester County are so dissimilar in student per capita expenditures and teacher salaries, physical facilities and other resources.

Economics of chartering one's yacht discussed; photo (S) ,"All boats are sold new by the Moorings and are custom-configured by the manufacturer, Beneteau, for charter use. The Moorings pays owners 25 percent of charter revenues and picks up all other costs. The Moorings estimates that the boat would generate $ 1,708 a month in charter revenue the first year, rising to $ 1,978 a month the fourth year, as charter rates increase. Although the Moorings does not account for depreciation, many charter programs do. Owners often reduce their income taxes by claiming depreciation on their boats. Boats that are purchased from charter programs often cost more than a comparable boat bought from a dealer. Because many charter programs only accept boats purchased from them. The typical off-the-shelf boat needs some modification for charter use.''Used boats may make a better investment."

Lawrence G Foster letter on August 11 article about Sunbeam Corp's struggles ,"But this premise should be a reminder to corporate America of the wisdom of following the path of greater responsibility. Giving the corporation this added dimension of responsibility is also a smart way to run a business. Some 50 years ago, Robert Wood Johnson, who built Johnson & amp; Johnson into a worldwide enterprise, wrote a corporate credo that expressed his philosophy of managing a business. In a business society, every act of business has social consequences and may arouse public interest. They understand that business is not an island in our society, but an integral part of the community, serving customers, employees and stockholders alike. In 1982, and again in 1986, the Tylenol crises put Johnson & amp; Johnson and Robert Wood Johnson's philosophy to a severe test."
"Elisabeth Miller-Fox letter notes that women are the market for Sunbeam products, and that she will donate her blender to charity and buy a Hamilton Beach ","To the Editor: Mr. Dunlap apparently does n't realize women are the market for Sunbeam / Oster products and that, when we buy products, we also buy a corporate culture. As a result, I, for one, plan to donate my Sunbeam blender to charity and replace it with a Hamilton Beach. If other women do, too, we can watch how successful he is at marketing Sunbeam products to the likes of him. ELISABETH MILLER-FOX Vero Beach, Fla., Aug. 11"

Letter by Alabama Gov Fob James Jr defends his deal to attract Mercedes to state (S) ,"( Sept. 1 ), by Allen R. Myerson, examined the debate over how Alabama attracted the German auto maker and 1,500 new jobs at a cost approaching $ 300 million in tax breaks and other subsidies. The article drew these responses from readers: To the Editor: Greetings from Stuttgart, Germany, where I'm leading a delegation of Alabama business leaders on an industry recruiting journey. Next year, we'll take great pride in launching Mercedes's new M-class all-activity vehicle, made in Alabama by Alabamians. Until Mercedes located in Alabama three years ago, many of the German companies opening their doors this week to our delegation were not even aware of Alabama, its skilled work force and bountiful resources. Sept. 6The writer is the Governor of Alabama."
"Mark Rollinson letter questions propriety of Alabama's using public money to lure private business, Mercedes, to state (S) ","( Sept. 1 ), by Allen R. Myerson, examined the debate over how Alabama attracted the German auto maker and 1,500 new jobs at a cost approaching $ 300 million in tax breaks and other subsidies. If you were a General Motors shareholder living in Alabama, how would you feel about paying taxes to your state for the purpose of subsidizing a plant for a G.M. competitor? About the same way, I suppose, as my chip manufacturing client felt recently when Virginia granted huge subsidies to three chip manufacturers-- two of them foreign-- to build plants here. Favoritism by way of tax-supported subsidy, in the long run, hurts business. What helps attract, hold and build business, and the money to finance business, is a good business climate."
"Richard Hyse letter on Alabama's lures to Mercedes; suggests it would have been more cost-efficient to just pay off welfare recipients, creating instant middle class ","'' O Governor, Wo n't You Buy Me a Mercedes Plant?''

The article drew these responses from readers: To the Editor: In these days of ending welfare as we know it, would it not have been more cost-efficient to pay $ 100,000 directly to each of 3,000 welfare recipients, thereby creating an instant substantial middle class with some spending and investment possibilities in Alabama, instead of routing these funds through a long chain of bureaucratic red tape to Mercedes-Benz at a cost of $ 200,000 each for only 1,500 recipients?RICHARD HYSE Oswego, N.Y., Sept. 2"
Larry Rasmussen letter on Alabama's lures to Mercedes (S) ,"( Sept. 1 ), by Allen R. Myerson, examined the debate over how Alabama attracted the German auto maker and 1,500 new jobs at a cost approaching $ 300 million in tax breaks and other subsidies. The article drew these responses from readers: To the Editor: The significance of the Mercedes plant in Alabama is lost if attention is riveted only on sufficient economic incentives to make the world attractive to commerce. But this is an example of feudalism in a new key, where the private entities lack loyalty to place and commitment to community. In the new feudalism, the princes can live where they wish. The successful can secede from the serfs and be linked to the great commercial and recreational nodes of the world by jet, modem, fax, satellite and fiber-optic cable."
"Hugh Johnson article offers a tour of Cambridge, Eng, where he studied; photos; map (special section, The Sophisticated Traveler) (part 2 of 2-part section) (L) ","Cambridge was a business town before it was invaded by students. Seventeen Cambridge colleges have foundation dates on or before 1800. There are a total of 31-- but no campus, unless you consider the whole interwoven mixture of colleges and town a campus. The domestic scale is the essence of Cambridge. From every point of view King's College Chapel is the climax of the Cambridge experience. Spenser and Gray were Pembroke men. , Trinity is much the biggest Cambridge college. They may be rented at either Silver Street Bridge or Magdalene Bridge. From Magdalene, though, the most tempting route back to the Garden House is south along the Backs, past St. John's, past Trinity and the Wren Library, then across the noble stone bridge that leads to Clare College."

Ken Sternberg letter says WFUV seems like a good radio station only because the rest of New York's radio dial is so bad ,"Contrary to the image portrayed, that WFUV is a shining beacon for noncommercial folk music, the station has become homogenous, boring and nearly commercial in its sound. WFUV's philosophy is to force-feed listeners the same songs day after day with a minuscule sprinkling of'' classic'' or new folk music that minimally justifies WFUV's self-polished halo. The station often plays highly commercial artists, like Sting, the Subdudes or the Wallflowers, who have little trouble being played on commercial stations. But like a desert mirage this is illusory, and the station slakes a thirst for true folk music just about as well."
Robert Lederman letter scores harassment of New York City's street artists by the police and BID police ,"To the Editor: Your article'' Is This Man Dangerous?'' was an accurate depiction of the illegal harassment endured by New York City's street artists. To add insult to injury, the city sells the art and art supplies it illegally confiscates from artists at auction. Fifth Avenue has become a well-oiled police state. On most days there are at least two uniformed police officers assigned to every block, an equal number of private B.I.D. police and numerous plainclothes officers in unmarked cars continuously driving up and down the streets. Their main assignment is to prevent any artists or disabled veteran vendors from setting up. The'' Going Out of Business'' signs on storefronts never represented vacancies. The writer is president of Artists' Response to Illegal State Tactics."
Rod Jackman letter opposes the proposed location of two shelters for the homeless in East Harlem ,"To the Editor: I vigorously protest the headline--'' After a Decade of Tolerance,' Nimby' Comes to East Harlem''-- on your Aug. 25 article on two proposed East Harlem shelters. The term'' Nimby'' is inappropriate, insensitive and offensive. Nimby can not reasonably apply to an area that contains the second-highest concentration of shelters in Manhattan. Eddie Baca, chairman of Community Board 11, must be commended for his courageous stand on this issue, because he knows Section 202 of the 1989 City Charter was designed to ameliorate precisely such gross imbalances in the siting of facilities. A more fruitful approach may be to investigate why some areas of this city remain impervious to the placement of facilities, while other areas continue to be oversaturated. ROD JACKMANHarlem"

It is safe to say, however, that had the mini-explosions been Mr. Dole's, the questions about whether he had the temperament to be President would be relentless.

But 50 percent said Mr. Dole was spending more time attacking the President."
Paucity of solid research and accurate data on people who move in and out of welfare system discussed; economist Robert A Moffitt notes that members of Congress want to change behavior of recipients but ignore even the little research that has been done on effects of various incentives (S) ,"But it is difficult to determine from Government data how many of them work while on welfare or how long they stay on the rolls. nationwide.''But there is less demand for data on welfare benefits. For social insurance programs like Social Security, the Government keeps detailed data on a person's work history and lifetime earnings to compute benefits. It is relatively easy for the Federal Government to collect data on Social Security, Medicare and food stamps because Congress sets uniform national eligibility criteria and the Federal Treasury pays the entire cost of benefits. Social Security is able to provide an abundance of data to defend its programs. Moreover, there are complex interactions between welfare and other benefit programs like food stamps and Medicaid, which are often changed by Congress at the same time."
CIA's bungled secret project to topple Saddam Hussein of Iraq reviewed (S) ,"It already had a small cadre of cold war-hardened officers based in northern Iraq, a'' safe zone'' policed by United States warplanes. The officers helped smuggle Iraqi military defectors out of Iraq and into the paramilitary operation. It had to be small and secret. Still, the death of several dozen trusted Iraqi agents is no small matter. Saddam devotes a lot more resources to his self-preservation than you are able to marshal for his removal,'' said Richard Haass, a former national security aide to President Bush now at the Brookings Institution."
"US determination to enforce restrictions on Iraq from the air, not with any ground troops, noted; photos (S) ","AS the United States approached another military showdown with Iraq last week, nobody, but nobody at the Defense Department talked publicly about the possibility of sending American ground troops back to war in the Persian Gulf.

Wall Street speculation in insurance stocks and other industries that would be affected by hurricanes noted; photo (S) ,"AS hurricanes approach, some people buy candles and hunker down. As hurricane after hurricane has appeared this year-- last week it was Hurricane Hortense-- speculators have looked around for industries that would be severely damaged. They bought orange juice futures, hoping that the price of juice would skyrocket if a hurricane devastated Florida citrus areas. They bought natural gas futures, hoping that a hurricane might damage wells in the Gulf Coast. And orange juice futures prices are down, with the trees still healthy. And while oil prices have risen-- thank you, Saddam Hussein-- natural gas prices have proved quite disappointing to the hurricane speculators. Hurricane season has a couple of months to go."

In the Bronx, voters have a choice between State Senator Guy Velella the Republican candidate and Guy Velella the Democratic nominee.

White House releases packet of brief statements from Pres Clinton's doctors; offers portrait of 50-year-old man in vigorous health and seeks to counter accusations by Bob Dole that Clinton has only partially disclosed information about his medical records (M) ,"By releasing a packet of brief statements from President Clinton's doctors on Friday night, the White House offered a picture of a 50-year-old man in vigorous health and sought to counter accusations by his opponent, Bob Dole, that Mr. Clinton had only partially disclosed information about his medical records. The statements were largely an elaboration of what the White House had previously said. They included a four-page summary from Dr. E. Connie Mariano, the senior White House physician, about Mr. Clinton's medical history and results of laboratory tests. The White House also released a similar packet about the health of Vice President Al Gore, 48. Clinton tested negative for H.I.V. in 1990. THE MEDICAL RECORD"

The storm roared through North Carolina on Sept. 5, causing damage that state and local officials said would be well into the billions of dollars. George Bush won the state by the slimmest of margins in 1992-- 43.5 percent to 42.7 percent for Mr. Clinton and 13.7 percent for Ross Perot-- and polls this summer showed Mr. Clinton virtually tied in North Carolina with his Republican challenger, Bob Dole."
Maureen Dowd Op-Ed column on sometimes bizarre ways in which two Presidential candididates think they are appealing to female voters(S) ,"Both parties think suburban women will be the key, so they try to latch on to the nurturing aura of Family Circle, Ricki Lake and Rosie O'Donnell. If women wanted revenge for decades of being ignored while their men talked sports and politics, they got it. Since Geraldine Ferraro was put on the ticket in 1984, many elections have been christened the Year of the Woman. This year, women have more clout than ever, but it is not measured by how female candidates are doing, or how close women came to getting on a national ticket. This year, women will get credit for a breathtaking achievement: Taking sports out of the Olympics and politics out of the conventions.

"Editorial criticizes Bob Dole for reaching back into Senate to block treaty to ban development, sale and use of chemical weapons; charges Dole derails treaty negotiated by Republican administrations in order to pick a fight with Pres Clinton ","No treaty can absolutely prevent terrorists and other outlaws from smuggling small quantities of chemical weapons. American military leaders, responsible politicians of both parties and the American chemical industry all favor the treaty. Dole complained that the convention imposed intrusive paperwork on American industry and risked the trade secrets of American chemical manufacturers. But the agreement's inspection and paperwork provisions were negotiated in close cooperation with the chemical industry. The United States is already destroying most of its own chemical weapons arsenal, and current Pentagon doctrine excludes the use of these weapons even in response to a chemical attack. Dole's new scorched-earth strategy in Congress was not limited to the chemical weapons treaty. But imperiling the Chemical Weapons Convention is trifling with the national interest."
Editorial Notebook on Federal lawsuit by largely black city of Chester against state of Pennsylvania for alleged discrimination in locating waste-disposal facilities within city's borders ,"But during the last decade, Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection issued permits for five waste plants in Chester, with the capacity to handle more than two million tons of waste per year. According to the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, Chester treats all of the county's solid waste and 85 percent of its sewage. But Chester residents went to court this spring, after the state issued a permit for yet another waste facility, to be placed in a part of the city that already had several. Two years ago, White House executive order required every Federal agency to make environmental justice a high priority. Whatever the local zoning and environmental laws say, the state has a moral obligation not to allow poor, desperate communities to turn themselves into waste dumps."
"Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column on frozen US-Iranian relations; explains that, in common with other revolutionary societies, Iran's traditional national interests are reasserting themselves, and should be used by US to redevelop working relationship with Teheran (S) ","There is no question that the domestic needs of Iran's Islamic leadership dictate a hostile relationship with America. And that's why although Iran's domestic needs may dictate a hostile relationship with America today, its foreign policy needs dictate a working relationship with America today. Geopolitically speaking, the animosity between Iran and the U.S. is unnatural and the current Iraq crisis only underscores that point. Remember: Iran is an empire. On every border Iran has ethnic communities that could easily switch sides. Unbeknownst to most Americans, the U.S. did Iran a huge strategic favor in 1991. This created a huge refugee problem for cash-strapped Iran. This enabled Iran to send its Kurdish refugees back across the border."
Excerpts from Jack Kemp's address to Christian Coalition convention in Washington (In His Own Words column) (S) ,"All human beings must have the same human rights; but all citizens also have an equal voice in Government. This places an extra burden on those who think they know what is right-- to do what is right the right way...

Review of various initiatives to improve airline and airport security following crash of TWA Flight 800 (S ,"Two months has not been long enough for investigators to determine why Trans World Airlines Flight 800 crashed, but it has been long enough for a White House commission to devise counterterrorism recommendations and for Congress and the aviation industry to argue over them. Presuming that a bomb caused the crash, a commission led by Vice President Al Gore has proposed major improvements in searching baggage, computer checks on passengers and vetting of airline and airport employees. The airlines have called for new steps, too, mostly to be taken by the Government. Congress worries about the costs, estimated at $ 1 billion, a third of it for security. Another Federal report last week said the F.A.A.'s agents often overstated airport security and made efforts to help airlines do well on inspections. MATTHEW L. WALDSeptember 8- 14"

Review of new study finding that teen-agers whose parents once smoked marijuana regularly are more likely to use it than other teen-agers (S)&#xFFFD; ,"Teen-agers whose parents once puffed marijuana regularly are more likely to use it than other teen-agers, a new study found. The study, released by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, reached the conclusion after polling parents and teen-agers: Parents who had frequently used marijuana were less alarmed than others by the prospect that their children might try it. Given that ambivalence, their children were more likely to experiment than others. The report confirmed recent statistics showing a jump in teen drug use. Twenty-two percent of children ages 12 to 17 said they were likely to try illegal drugs, up from 11 percent last year. TRIP GABRIELSeptember 8- 14"

Maria A Martin letter says American corporations can make money despite sanctions against outlaw nations ,"( Business Day, Sept. 11 ) leaves a strong sense of some American companies' disapproval of the use of economic sanctions as a foreign policy tool. American companies are in business to make money, and sanctions stand in the way. At face value, this sentiment is understandable. American business must mature in its business ambitions. Making money is the objective, but not at the expense of prostituting American values. Multilateral sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Libya, for example, would help level the playing field for American companies. If the public relations people play their cards right, they can give American companies doing business abroad the human face they so often lack and make more reliable business partners."

Fites, the Caterpillar chairman, quoted from his unpublished opinion article, to assume gullibility on the part of the reader. Fites says of unlilateral trade sanctions that the real pressure is on United States companies that must cede American jobs to foreign companies. A public company's main ambition is to increase net worth. As American corporations have sent jobs overseas by the thousands and their respective stocks have risen, executives have almost without exception spoken not of retraining displaced employees but of the need to compete in the international marketplace. In truth, then, Mr. Fites should have stated simply that these unilateral trade sanctions just might inhibit raising next quarter's dividends."
Ernest Stern letter on Sept 5 article about Bob Dole's work on behalf of special interests recalls formerly widespread belief that bribery was immoral and corrupt ,"Your Sept. 5 front-page article on Bob Dole's legislative skill over the years in providing special tax breaks for corporations in exchange for millions of dollars of campaign contributions is the latest example of corruption throughout the legislative and executive branches of government. Our political leaders in and out of office are unable to effect true reform because they are trapped in a corrupt and corrupting system. Perhaps a few courageous newspapers like The New York Times, can stir up sufficient public outrage to cause the enactment of binding legislation that will do the job. That should help re-establish public confidence in our political system and enable ethical people to enter public life."

Five years later, in another security evaluation, Port Authority security officials said that 54 percent of the recommendations had been or were about to be implemented. Port Authority officials say they did hold extensive informal discussions with airline security directors at Kennedy. In 1991, after the Lockerbie bombing, the Port Authority installed a new terminal security system at Kennedy Airport. At the time the authority began to install the system, the security focus was still concentrated on hijacking rather than bombing. I think that's been the nature of security."
