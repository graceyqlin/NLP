Nicholas Eberstadt reviews book The Return of Thrift: How the Coming Collapse of the Middle-Class Welfare State Will Reawaken Values in America by Phillip Longman (L) ,"By Phillip Longman. The Social Security trust fund has already been'' saved'' ( to great political acclaim ) from impending bankruptcy at least twice: under Jimmy Carter in 1977 and under Ronald Reagan in 1983. In this timely and provocative book, Phillip Longman, a journalist, likens the Social Security system to a'' chain letter'' reaching its inevitable denouement. But according to Mr. Longman, things look even worse for tomorrow's retirees ( and taxpayers ) than the crisis in Social Security might indicate. Just as welfare has fostered dependency among the poor, programs like Social Security and Medicare have fostered dependency among the middle class.'' Though Mr. Longman's rendition of the message hits some false notes, the message itself could hardly be more important."

Some lawmakers raised concerns about supporting any tax increase at all. There are legitimate concerns that the tax increase could not have generated the projected $ 135 million a year to help pay off bonds for school construction, because more people may look to buy cigarettes out of state, and others might actually give up smoking.

"Report on eviction wars in New York City, ages-old struggle between landlord's right to a livelihood and return on investment, and tenant's need for affordable shelter; about 300,000 New York City tenants are served with eviction papers each year, and about 100,000 of those are eventually ordered out of their homes; at that point, some grudgingly pay and stay, others leave on their own, and still others--about 25,000 last year--find themselves out on street; some cases reviewed; photos (L) ","So the fact that about 300,000 New York City tenants are served with eviction papers each year is, at once, both understandable and remarkable. More and more, the advocates say, landlords are going to court not so much to get the back rent, but to get the tenant out. There ought to be a law requiring tenants to place withheld rent in escrow, landlord lobbyists insist. Another ground is the tenant's failure to maintain the apartment as his or her primary residence. A tenant who does n't respond defaults and the court will grant a judgment of eviction, unless the landlord's petition is obviously defective. The requirements for a landlord to obtain an eviction in New York, and particularly in New York City, are generally considered more stringent than in other states."

Supraphon SU 0192-2 231; CD.Prague has always been one of central Europe's most international cities-- never more so than in the time of Rudolph II, at the turn of the 17th century, when a large German population supplemented the native Bohemians, with healthy Jewish, Dutch and Italian contingents added to the mix. Strewn among unremarkable examples of polyphony are interesting moments, particularly in the inventive piece by the Slovenian composer Jacobus Handl-Gallus that gives the album its name. This is no particular handicap for the Latin numbers, whose texts can be tracked down elsewhere, but it is a real problem for those in Czech."
"Letter by Melvin Wilk on Wendy Lesser's Jyly 14 article on attention being paid to Anthony Julius's book T S Eliot, Anti-Semitism and Literary Form ","To the Editor: In her essay'' The T. S. Eliot Problem'' ( July 14 ), Wendy Lesser argues that a work may be anti-Jewish but still be ethical. I suspect it is not a'' narrow'' moralism that causes Anthony Julius, the author of'' T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form,'' to deny the ethical authority of Eliot's poetry, but an ethical outlook broad enough to embrace human dignity and self-respect. Is n't it obvious that when an author's anti-Semitism is evident, as in Eliot's poetry, those poems are compromised as poems? I am a Christian and therefore not an anti-Semite,'' Eliot insisted, perhaps somewhat idealistically."

His iteration of the Wesseling thesis confuses two diplomatic gatherings, the Congress of Berlin of 1878 and the Berlin Conference on West Africa of 1884-85.The 1878 congress did indeed focus on the fallout from Russia's victory over the Ottomans. The Berlin Conference, on the other hand, was called specifically with Africa in mind. But the point is that Mr. Wesseling argues that the Berlin Conference was not called to divide up Africa, as has long been assumed. Of that conference he writes,'' Africa was not only not divided at Berlin, but the subject was not even on the agenda; indeed, the partition of Africa was explicitly rejected by the conference.''"

Paul Griffiths reviews book Stravinsky and the Russian Traditions: A Biography of the Works Through 'Marva' by Richard Taruskin; photo (L) ,"STRAVINSKY AND THE RUSSIAN TRADITIONS Stravinsky himself is partly to blame. In deep details Stravinsky's music was always Russian, animated and informed by living forces from Russia, pervaded by Russian attitudes and stories. The quest for Stravinsky's sources becomes, time and again, a detective story. It begins with an exhaustive study of the music Stravinsky wrote, and heard, during the years before the success of'' The Firebird'' in 1910. But the seeds were there, in the acquaintance with Rimsky-Korsakov and other Russian music of the period. Benois's twin invitations, to folklore and to formalism, led Stravinsky to his first pathbreaking work. We live, he says, in a musical world made Russian by Stravinsky's overwhelming example."

So we returned the car to Avis in Perpignan one day after we drove it away from Barcelona. The drop-off penalty that we were assessed by Avis-Barcelona was approximately $ 1,000!I contacted Avis after our return home, and they advised me that Europe was a separate entity and that mediation was the only help it could extend. Accordingly, I would advise travelers to secure insurance that includes trip-interruption coverage to provide protection from greedy franchisees."

Paula V Smith letter on Jason DeParle's account (July 14) of Republican debate over abortion ,"Jason DeParle's account of the Republican debate over abortion makes an inadvertent point by representing in its text and pictures only those who are least affected by the realities of the issue ('' A Fundamental Problem,'' July 14 ). The people quoted, from the Presidential contenders to the'' middled-aged'' female voter of the closing anecdote, are not the ones facing unplanned pregnancy. To them, abortion is an abstract concept-- an article of religious doctrine or a bargaining counter exploited for political gain. What struck me most could be read only between the lines: in the Republican debate over abortion, the forgotten voices are those of the women for whom it represents a real, rather than a rhetorical, experience.

In phase two a special bait is placed in those stations with termite activity. Instead the termites enter the station and feed on it. Hexaflumuron does not kill the termites directly.

About eight months before the Valujet crash, Mr. Cabell cut his then 400,000-share position in the carrier in half, to take some profits when the stock was selling between $ 20 and $ 25.

Halton Adler Mann says Columbus Circle in New York has most repulsive conglomeration of architectural atrocities ever to inhabit a public space; suggests creating park-in-the-round (S) ,"To the Editor: Herbert Muschamp's analysis of the'' white elephant'' at 2 Columbus Circle ( appraisal, July 31 ) does not mention that the circle has the most repulsive conglomeration of architectural atrocities ever to inhabit a public plaza with the possible exception of Boston's Government Center. It is too late for Columbus Circle to aspire to the 19th-century symmetry of a Parisian place or square. But if the Huntington Hartford and Edward Durell Stone folly is to be razed, it would create an opportunity for a vest-pocket park with a waterfall, trees and benches. Columbus Circle could be made into a park-in-the-round with grass and shade trees replacing the dreadful macadam, and traffic could be diverted with tunnels under it connecting Eighth Avenue with Central Park West and upper and lower Broadway."

Cory Franklin letter on news media's naming of suspect in bombing at Atlanta Olympic Games; says impact of such reports on public perception should not be underestimated ,"To the Editor: Regarding your Aug. 1 news article on the news media's naming of a bomb suspect in the Atlanta Olympics case, the impact of press reporting on public perception of a suspect's guilt or innocence should not be underestimated. We need look no further than the case of Trans World Airlines Flight 800, in which a bomb is strongly suspected as the cause of the crash. Even though the alleged Unabomber, Theodore J. Kaczynski has not yet been convicted of anything, the reason he is not a suspect in the T.W.A. crash in that the public is convinced, through media reporting, that the Unabomber has been captured."

Finding of Clovis-style spear points in Siberia noted; photo; spear points have been believed to be distinctly American invention (S) ,"Not so long ago, scholars seemed close to agreement on when and how ancient people first colonized America. About 12,000 years ago, hunters followed their mammoth and mastodon prey across the Bering land bridge from Siberia into Alaska, then southward throughout the Americas. The clearest pieces of evidence were their gracefully fluted stone spear points, thought to be a distinctly American invention. Recent discoveries show humans in the New World much earlier, and last week American and Russian archeologists reported finding for the first time one of the Clovis-style spear points in Siberia, near the city of Magadan. The Siberian point appears to be only 8,300 years old and not exactly like the American weapons, but close enough to force reconsideration of where the technology was developed first-- in Asia or America.

"Op-Ed article by Steve Goldsmith, mayor of Indianapolis and Republican nominee for Indiana governor, welcomes dismantling of Federal welfare system; says cities should integrate assistance with encouragement for responsible fatherhood and work; notes cities can dismantle welfare bureaucracy and be flexible (S) ","Last week's historic action to dismantle the Federal welfare system could not have come too soon. Under the existing welfare program, intact families are punished by the system, and the government takes the place of the father. But the long-term benefit of encouraging family formation far outweighs any short-term increase in the cost of administering welfare. * Cities can transform welfare into a jobs program. * Cities can dismantle the welfare bureaucracy. Recently I met with a group of 30 welfare recipients enrolled in an innovative job-training program in New York City. I asked them if their welfare caseworkers had helped them find jobs. The current welfare system is like most government agencies. Instead of paying welfare workers to hand out checks, we must pay organizations for finding people jobs."

"'truth,' meet consequences**Demise of Pravda, oracle of Soviet Communism, noted; photo (S) ","In the Soviet Union, those lucky few who could read both the official press and Western newspapers might have felt they were reading about two parallel universes-- in Pravda's case, a universe remarkably predictable, since everything fit the lessons the Communist rulers wanted readers to learn. With the Soviet collapse, though, much of the Russian press set out to adopt global journalistic standards: Not always objective, but at least intent on engaging readers with something that rang true. Somehow, the old Communist Party organ ( whose name, ironically, means'' Truth'' ) poked along as the organ of truths only a Communist could see."

Like many of her compatriots, she suspects that Mexico's association with the United States and Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement is one cause of her downward slide. In that context, the trade treaty, which was preceded by reforms opening Mexico to foreign investment, seems almost certainly to have saved Mexico from meltdown. A national sounding taken in June by the Mexico City newspaper Reforma found that 67 percent of Mexicans believed that the Government was having little or no success with the free-trade treaty. In several recent cases the effects of the political scandals have been straightforward,'' said Jonathan Heath, an economist in Mexico City."

Maybe women felt that way at one time, but hardly today. And as for buying a bathing suit, it should take about as much time as flipping through your favorite catalogue and making a toll-free call. Articles like this serve to reinforce the stereotypical image of women who are too busy thinking about their bodies to ever crack the glass ceiling."
Gilbert Hawkins letter in defense of cicadas (S) ,"Your brief article'' Why Are Oaks Turning Brown? The insect that emerges in such great numbers every 17 years may often be called by the nickname 17-year locust, but it is not a locust and should not be confused with one. It is said that early settlers, lacking a better explanation for their numbers, assumed that the 17-year insects were locusts. In fact, they are periodical cicadas. Periodical cicadas are among the longest-living insects. Though other broods will be emerging in other parts of the country, we have had the pleasure of a rare natural phenomenon. The cicada's visit is over for another 17 years. LeoniaThe writer is resident naturalist at the Elisabeth Morrow School in Englewood."

The 1992 health insurance law that this act modifies has already robbed self-employed professionals of essential medical treatment: we were disqualified from our group health insurance and singled out for unfair cost burdens imposed by inferior individual coverage that many can not afford.

The purpose of New Jersey's ongoing health insurance reform is not to help the state's citizens."
Letter by George S Katsarakes on June 16 article on recommending piecework as successful motivation technique&#xFFFD; ,"Over and over, I've seen that driving people or encouraging them to increase output with little regard to all facets of a production-type job is irresponsible leadership. In addition, such a system discourages operators from learning new skills, helping less experienced co- workers or developing a team approach on the production line. Unnecessary inventory in both components and finished products is another byproduct of the piecework system. Furthermore, the examples cited in the article were not representative of production lines but were more typical of small businesses, in which individuals make a complete product and which are easier to manage.

Medical risks to women from pregnancy noted (S) ,"Most concerns involving pregnancy and birth focus on the developing fetus or the newborn. Often getting little attention these days, experts say, are the adverse effects on the mothers. A Department of Health and Human Services report released last week said the number of American women who die or suffer serious health consequences due to pregnancy and childbirth appears to have been greatly underestimated. The reported maternal death rate of 10 per 100,000 live births may be less than half the actual figure, it said. And there are an estimated 3,100 hospitalizations for pregnancy-related complications for each maternal death. Experts said many Americans have come to believe that childbirth is either risk-free or easily managed by modern medicine. The vast majority of pregnancies end normally, they said, but people should n't underestimate the hazards that remain."

Ninety-nine percent of our clients are on welfare. What would I do about welfare? ( After all, that's really where this current welfare legislation is aimed.)Strengthen the schools. Real welfare reform is now up to the states. The measure replaces a welfare system with a work program. At the same time, we actually know a lot about how to move people from welfare to work. We're all in favor of ending welfare as we know it, but with real job creation."

Unlike T.W.A. Flight 800, Pan Am Flight 103 offered investigators strong indications that the explosion was a result of terrorism even before the first piece of evidence was picked off the ground in Lockerbie. Investigators determined that the Air-India crash and the bomb at the Tokyo airport were related, and the trail of clues began in Vancouver. If two bombs had not gone off on or near planes that originated in Vancouver, investigators may never have concluded that the Air-India flight was brought down by a bomb.'' In one way, Flight 800 investigators have an advantage over their counterparts in the Air-India downing."

The Mayor also appointed Raul Russi, currently the city's Sheriff, to become the new Commissioner of Probation. Hanley has worked at the city's labor office for the last 24 years. One of Mr. Hanley's biggest challenges will be to reach agreements with the city's uniformed unions, primarily the police and fire unions, whose contracts expired more than a year ago. The Mayor has clashed with the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association and the Uniformed Firefighters Association over a new state law that allows those unions to arbitrate contract disputes at the state level.

Mr. Dole has been moving back and forth on this, but the aides said late today that he seemed inclined to accept the tax cut proposal rather than a more complicated plan to roll back Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase. The plan might call for permanent elimination of the 4.3 cents-a-gallon gasoline tax that was enacted in 1993.Another option that Mr. Dole had originally favored called for a repeal of the 1990 tax increase as well as the 1993 increase.

The spraying, which began in South Texas last year, was widely blamed for an invasion of the beet army worm that destroyed the area's cotton crop. In March, farmers in eastern Mississippi, who also had a poor cotton crop last year, voted to end eradication effort there. Indeed, throughout South Texas, the future of cotton ginning does not look bright. The assessment led many farmers to plant sorghum instead of cotton this year. South Texas growers planted cotton on just 150,000 acres, less than half the acreage planted last year."

He said that he already had won three medals and that it was time to give other teammates a chance at the gold.''They deserve it,'' Owens said.

We put aside Presidential politics.''The welfare bill is plainly the creation of Congressional Republicans, and easy for them to run on. But the health insurance bill is a striking example of creative credit-taking. This bill which is being passed is clearly the descendant of the Michel bill,'' Republicans accused him of trying to block health insurance legislation. But behind the scenes, House Republicans were yielding to his insistence on changes in the bill that would tighten rules on how insurance companies would provide policies to people who changed jobs. It is important for Republicans to get credit for measures with political resonance, like welfare and health insurance. Democrats chortled at the passage of the wage and insurance bills.

The latter style of blitzing is the rage in the National Football League, and the young Giants will probably see a lot of it. When this happens, it can be like playing an entirely new defense. The Giants' struggles against the zone blitzes were evident against Jacksonville, particularly in the first quarter. Then in the second quarter against the Jaguars' second-team defense-- which blitzed less often-- the Giants were better able to move the ball. The good news for the Giants is that Brown was reading many of these blitzes well. Also, the Giants' offensive linemen are smart."

Janet Gallagher letter says 'policing' of pregnancies will only drive 'troubled' women away from help ,"It is no surprise to see these harsh measures proposed by Mr. Murphy, who in 1993 as the Cook County Public Guardian tried to obtain a court order to compel an Illinois woman to undergo a Caesarean section over her religious objections. The court agreed with the American Civil Liberties Union's arguments upholding the woman's constitutional right to bodily integrity and self-determination in reproductive decision making. The woman eventually gave vaginal birth to a health baby. Many courts have dismissed such charges because they recognized that the Constitution and common law guarantee women's rights to bodily integrity, self-determination and privacy, and because they realized that such measures would drive women away from medical care. We can and should do everything to provide pregnant women with information, prenatal care and therapy for substance abuse or disease."

And what of heavy drinking?Many more children are harmed every year from prenatal alcohol use than by cocaine or marijuana. This is particularly a concern for minority women, and for good reason. The National Association for Perinatal Addiction Research and Education reports that black women are 10 times more likely to be tested for in utero drug use than white women, though actual drug use is the same for both groups. Pregnant drug addicts need help; given it, many stop using."

Even as we pass measures to penalize foreign companies trading with'' outlaw'' nations, we continue to renew preferred trade status for China despite its sales of missile technology and nuclear reactors to aggressive regimes. That trading status encourages China to behave as a responsible member of the world community, an argument the Europeans merely echo in explaining their economic ties to Cuba and Libya.

Once, Kukoc, Dino Radja, Drazen Petrovic and Divac played on what was probably the best non-American basketball team ever. Upset that divisive politics had infiltrated his team, Divac pulled the flag away. Months before he died, Petrovic said he would never forgive Divac for that.

But the new welfare legislation hardly even pretends to deal with real problems. Everyone agrees that welfare recipients should work if they can. But everyone also knows that mothers on welfare can not work unless they have help on child care and medical needs-- help that will cost government more, not less. The much-applauded welfare plan of Wisconsin's Republican Governor, Tommy Thompson, meets those needs. A young mother with no work experience and no child care will find a job at once. And other Western societies, with different welfare systems, are experiencing the same phenomenon. So in a piece of legislation like the welfare bill we act in ignorance and frustration."

But Limon avoids the usual angst and explores a shifting relationship between lovers adrift in an unfamiliar and dangerous world that mirrors their own sudden strangeness toward each other. A radiant Ms. Watt shaped stark, elegant calligraphic dance forms of another century in Limon's'' Chaconne.''Mr."

Editorial urges Clinton Administration not to further delay planned sale of limited amounts of Iraqi oil on world market; says Administration seems more interested in looking tough on Iraq in election year than dealing with painful side effects of oil embargo (M) ,"The United States has made an honorable and reasonable effort to be sure that a planned humanitarian break in the Iraqi oil embargo is not abused by Saddam Hussein, but Washington should now stand back and let the oil flow. After years of diplomatic stalemate, Iraq earlier this year accepted an American-sponsored plan to allow a limited resumption of Iraqi oil exports to pay for food and medicine. Some of the oil income would also finance reparations payments to the victims of Iraqi aggression and United Nations administrative costs. The plan would not end the oil export sanctions imposed on Iraq for the past six years. It would permit Iraq to sell $ 2 billion worth of oil over the next six months-- about 20 percent of its normal export level."
Editorial says decision by Federal Communications Commission to issue guidelines to open up $100 billion local phone industry to competition is prudent move (S) ,"The 1996 Telecommunications Act promised to open up the $ 100 billion local telephone industry to competition-- giving local phone customers a choice of doing business with a company other than Nynex, Bell Atlantic or the other Baby Bells. If the Baby Bells had been allowed to overcharge for these services, they could have undermined Congress's goal of more local competition. The commission simply set forth a basic economic principle to guide state action-- telling the Baby Bells to charge just enough for the use of their wires, switches or services like directory assistance to cover the costs that an efficient firm would incur. Some regulatory authorities, like the New York State Public Service Commission, are already moving to create a competitive local telephone industry."

Congress passed a law in 1990 requiring airlines to confirm that every checked bag belongs to a passenger on international flights.

"Analysis of Bob Dole's advocacy of $548 billion tax cut; Dole is betting Presidential election and his career on being able to persuade electorate to come down on his side of complex and often bitter dispute, namely, over whether it is possible to slash taxes in American political system without sending deficit skyhigh again, and if so, whether smaller government that results will lead to faster economic growth and improved living standards (M) ","No political strategy is considered more potent by Republicans or truer to their core beliefs than promising big tax cuts. The original supply-side concept of targeted tax cuts quickly led to a general tax cut bidding war, with both parties joining in the frenzy. But in outlining Mr. Dole's economic platform today, Republican officials gave only sketchy details of how Mr. Dole would pay for the tax cuts he is proposing. A tax cutting plan could theoretically help boost the economy in two ways. If it is not accompanied by offsetting spending cuts or other revenue gains, a tax cut provides a short-term stimulus by putting more money into the economy, generating more growth for a short time but also inflation."

Drop in Silicon Graphics Inc stock after firm reported higher-than-expected earnings discussed; analysts cite slowing growth (M) ,"SILICON GRAPHICS INC. Yet in the two trading days that followed, Silicon Graphics shares fell as computer industry analysts lowered their estimates for fiscal 1997; at least two lowered their ratings on the stock.

Analysts and investors would like to feel that the fortunes of Silicon Graphics have bottomed and are on the way up again."

Many women are spending more on their bodies and less on what goes on them. For one thing, women's apparel prices have fallen more than men's. That is partly because there has been more competition in the women's business."

It was not uncommon to see a young person with mild back pain or headaches who was not otherwise disabled receiving welfare, free medical care and food stamps and living in subsidized housing.

Some New Jersey lawmakers have introduced legislation that would prohibit utility to pass to customers costs of nuclear plant that is off line for six months or more (New Jersey Daily Briefing (S) ,"Should utility customers have to pay for the cost of managing a nuclear power plant even when the plant is shut down? Nuclear power plants are expensive to maintain even if they are not operating, said Sen. John H. Adler, a Haddonfield Democrat who is a sponsor of the bills. Under the proposals, a utility would not be allowed to pass to customers the costs of a nuclear plant that is off line for six months or more. The bills are aimed at Public Service Electric and Gas Company's Salem I and Salem II nuclear power stations, which have not operated for more than a year because of mechanical problems. Last week, the State Board of Public Utilities said it would have hearings to decide whether the utility's customers were entitled to refunds."

Jon Pareles reviews the German duo Cluster at the Knitting Factory; photo (S) ,"Cluster made its New York debut about two decades late when it performed at the Knitting Factory on Sunday night as part of its first United States tour. The duo of Hans Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius started playing quiet, abstract electronic music in the 1970's and gained a reputation outside their native Germany when they recorded with Brian Eno in the late 1970's. Although electronic sounds offer a nearly unlimited palette, Cluster knows what it likes: floating, rounded timbres reminiscent of flutes and chimes. But Cluster avoids the sugary symmetries of New Age music. Its improvisations have a serene melancholy, with foreboding below the music's gleaming surface. But for the most part, Cluster turned musical sparseness into a haze of promising implications."

Unhappily, the deformed election coverage was not an exceptional case of bad journalism in the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Foreign-owned papers and private television expand the news spectrum, but most show little interest in serious political coverage, and can hurt the local media by sucking up scarce advertising. The controlled economies in these countries provide little advertising, so most papers are financed and indirectly controlled by the government or political organizations. Many formerly Communist countries now have only state-managed TV news. The new generation of authoritarian leaders in these countries is unlikely to warm to the principles of a free press on its own."

Of the $ 550 billion package of tax cuts, about $ 450 billion involve rate cuts on workers and investors-- the only kind that spur growth. By cutting Federal programs to pay for a tax cut today, Mr. Dole makes it that much harder tomorrow to pass any tax hikes and spending cuts needed to offset the looming deficits. What Mr. Dole would give voters is a huge tax cut with a promise of spending cuts that are either illusory or destructive."
"Dave Anderson, in Sports of The Times column, contends that Summer Games may not be held in US for another 25 years; maintains that with so many capable cities and governments around world eager to bid, International Olympic Committee is not likely to risk taking chance on what it disliked about Atlanta; photo (M) ","And when it's North America's turn, Toronto is a likelier site than New York. Please, anyplace but New York. But with 197 nations here, America's first world Olympics, such Southern hospitality was to be expected. But the Olympic movement is really all about Olympic millions. If the I.O.C. is so serious about the Olympic movement, it should move to eliminate some of its silly sports. If figure skating is in the Winter Games, ballet should be in the Summer Games. The best Olympic sports are those in which a gold medal is that sport's most important reward. Unfortunately for Atlanta and America, that too will be remembered as part of the Olympic experience."
Harvey Araton Sports of The Times column recalls unforgettable moments of Atlanta Olympics; photos (M) ,"The Cuban volleyball star Mireya Luis, conversely, sobbed at her team's gold medal news conference because, after 14 years on her national team, she realized that her dream of playing professionally abroad is dying. When Ghaffari placed his silver medal around Bob Dole's neck after kneeling with the candidate at the park bomb site, our Image-Is-Everything mentality was never clearer. Also at Greco-Roman, I saw a Cuban coach scowl and not so much as pat his wrestler on the back after he lost his gold medal match. Most of the athletes here did not need to win one gold medal or 10 gold medals to feel fulfilled. Out came the United States women gymnasts, fresh off the gold medal stand."

Families of victims of Trans World Airline Flight 800 crash have coalesced into formidable political force; their angry pleas over slow pace of body identification and bewildering morass of information from authorities served to focus unparalleled attention on aspect of aviation accidents long overlooked by Government and industry; Pres Clinton has proposed that specific office in Federal Government be set up to assist victims families in aviation tragedies (M) ,"Relatives of subsequent crash victims said they were treated little better, and with each bungled burial and mixed-up passenger list, more families have come together to demand change. But there is no one plan, no one agency, in charge of handling the needs of family members. For the families of the T.W.A. victims, other complications arose, much of it relating to a lack of coordination. But with the help of family advocates, some details fell smoothly into place. Information was delivered to the families at one central location, the hotel. But such progress has been slow in coming, government officials and family activists say. In many respects, the crash of a Valujet plane in the Florida Everglades in May proved a watershed for mourning families."
