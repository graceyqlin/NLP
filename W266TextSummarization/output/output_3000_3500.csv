Ben Ratliff reviews tenor-saxophonist Sonny Rollins concert in Damrosch Park; photo (M) ,"Having engendered an entire school of saxophone playing since he rose to prominence in the mid-1950's, Mr. Rollins keeps himself at a remove from the New York jazz life. The attention paid to his set lists has long been on a microscopic level, and Mr. Rollins's seemingly endless rounds of calypso choruses have sometimes been deemed self-indulgent. Playing with the rhythms of the calypsos, he hopped on a single note and turned the beat around, then began harmonic experiments with the songs, sometimes turning them minor and strangely sour. Mid-concert, he led off'' Tenor Madness,'' his own blues theme, with a long solo improvisation. But Mr. Rollins thrives on obstacles and trip wires, and his band gave him politeness instead."
"Rolling Stones Rock-and-Roll Circus, concert film featuring Rolling Stones and other rock performers, has been resurrected 28 years after it was made and will be shown in Oct at New York Film Festival; photo (M) ","When members of the Stones saw a preliminary version of the film, they balked. A planned reshoot of the Stones portion of the film never took place. ' There was the Hyde Park concert, and Woodstock, and then Altamont,'' he said, referring to major concerts involving the band that were captured on film.'' Parts of the film were lent to the Who. Some parts of the film began circulating in bootleg form, as did a black-and-white version of the entire film, with only three songs by the Stones. Mr. Lindsay-Hogg agreed to help edit a final version of the film. For Stones fans, the film is an opportunity to see the group's last public performance with Mr. Jones.''"
Alan Truscott Bridge column on unusual 1993 match in which player doubled confidently bid slam; diagrammed deal (M) ,"It has been recognized since the early days of the game that a player must be on very sure ground to double a confidently bid slam. If the contract fails by a trick, a double will gain 100. Further, the double may give away some valuable information to the declarer. The rash doubler on the diagramed deal, played in 1993 at the Beach Point Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y., defended six diamonds doubled after his partner had made a pre-emptive overcall of four spades. South was Jack Sonnenblick of Boca Raton, Fla., and after winning the opening spade lead, an obvious singleton, he took three top trumps and was surprised and pleased to find a normal split. He cashed two more trump winners and reached this position: NORTH-- A K Q"

Neil Strauss reviews Horde Festival at Downing Stadium (M) ,"Having a true appreciation of music means not listening to one style exclusively, but listening to and understanding good music no matter what genre it belongs to. Of course, as in previous years, the Horde tour remains hopelessly retro, but part of appreciating music is having a good understanding of its past. A third stage mixed high school rappers, drumming groups and roots-rock bands. Part of what made this year's Horde tour stand out from the limitations of other festivals was the range of instrumentation that the bands used, particularly on the second stage. Blues Traveler closed the festival with a lot of John Popper, who dominated the set with his harmonica playing."

The solo that opened his'' Swing Concerto,'' danced to klezmer music by Brave Old World, was full of folk shapes and inflections, of careful verticals and sudden optimistic tilts into the wind. Danced to music by Ornette Coleman, Terumasa Hino and Masabumi Kikuchi, the new piece pours out its performers through a quartet, a swing duet ( danced by Maria Lynn Vignone and Marius Z. Olszewski ) and a quintet, all of which evoke the music in often witty and thought-provoking ways. DANCE REVIEW"

Jon Pareles reviews Enit Music Festival at Garden State Arts Center; photo of singer and festival founder Perry Farrell (M) ,"The field next to the Garden State Arts Center became a muddy dance floor when the first Enit Festival settled in for an all-night music marathon, live and electronic, on Saturday. The Enit Festival provided the music, as well as an ecological statement. It wants to reunite fans of dance music, who are used to faceless disk jockeys providing machine-driven electronic rhythm tracks, with rock listeners drawn to charismatic live bands. The festival also threw in other forms of good-time music. Any festival that opens with a brass band has its heart in the right place. Re-Birth and the Sun Ra Arkestra, playing a set that mixed raucous free jazz and big-band ballads, provided some of the festival's most jubilant music. Only when a band member tried to rap did the music become earthbound."

"Change in Government's rules on television station ownership has sparked ferocious race among broadcasters to lock up as many stations as possible; appetite for expansion is particularly intense among companies that own largest stakes in television programming businesses, namely networks, and especially NBC and Fox; by owning stations, media companies can assure themselves wide distribution not only for shows their networks run, but also for other programming they produce and distribute (M) ","By owning stations, media companies can assure themselves wide distribution not only for the shows their networks run, but also for other programming they may produce and distribute. The television station business, on the other hand, is far more lucrative. Meanwhile, he said, cash flow margins for television stations can run from 25 percent to 50 percent if the stations are well managed. The relaxation of Federal Communications Commission rules has allowed media companies to expand the reach of their television stations to 35 percent of the American market from 25 percent. Some media experts believe that the F.C.C. will eventually allow companies to own more than one television station in each market, just as they can now own more than one radio station."

Asked about his family, he said only that he had lost relatives during the Vietnamese invasion that toppled the Khmer Rouge Government. Without Khmer Rouge participation, the election, held in 1993, produced an acrimonious coalition of the democratic forces and the former Vietnamese-backed government. That government had been headed by Mr. Hun Sen, who like many of his supporters is a former Khmer Rouge who broke with the movement.

The newspaper accounts of the discovery of the poisonous weed and the detention of canteen employees, two of whom fled 1,000 miles to their homes in Uttar Pradesh, also suggested possible motives. Shortcomings in hygiene, especially in the food chain, were emphasized by two other episodes of food poisoning, this time involving schoolchildren, that occurred in the same district as the textile town a week after the canteen disaster. The possibility that the canteen deaths resulted from datura poisoning set Indians to delving into folklore, which indicates that the weed has been used for centuries, especially in north India, for various kinds of skulduggery."

Editorial comments on proliferation of grasshoppers that heralds waning of summer (S) ,"This is a good hopper year in the West, if you happen to like hoppers. When horses walk through the tall, dry grass, they lower their heads and weave them back and forth, watching the insects fan out, listening to the sudden eruption, which sounds like high wind on brittle leaves or a kingfisher's distant call. One usually sees robins tugging at earthworms, but now the robins run along gravel roads, picking off hoppers. In the morning, as the sun is getting strong, the hoppers climb onto the eastern walls of ranch buildings, and wait until they are fully charged, ready to go off. The difference between an ant and a grasshopper is that a grasshopper believes in posterity while an ant prefers immediate family."

However, the various critics you quote have written in vain, I fear, because the field of footnote criticism has been preempted permanently by that renowned scholar, the late Vladimir Nabokov. His novel,'' Pale Fire,'' takes the form of voluminous footnotes to a 999-line poem. If sheer hilariousness could have brought an end to footnotes, they would no longer be a part of the scholar's armamentarium.

However, one point must not be overlooked: little pressure exists on the President to govern further to the left. Although arguably he could have afforded more support in some areas to less-enfranchised sectors of our society, the President simply can not move too far in this direction. In the absence of vigorous social movements like those of poor people, organized labor and minority groups, no chief executive, no matter how well meaning, could have resisted our era's conservative pressures.

"Autumnal migration of peregrine falcons from as far north as Alaska to as far south as Argentina is being revealed in detail thanks to tiny satellite transmitters fitted on their backs; researchers say peregrines, whose name suggests a tendency to wander, are being found far and wide, in locales both expected and unexpected; photo; map (M) ","The majority of what was previously known about the movements of peregrines came from the time-honored method of banding, in which biologists put identifying rings on the birds' legs. Researchers have also used low-flying planes to track individual peregrines that have been outfitted with radio transmitters. The problem is that the biologists must take the time to go through border checks, while peregrines, which can travel 500 miles a day, speed onward. As researchers trace these birds, filling in the large gaps left by the banding data and redrawing the boundaries of where peregrines fly, they are finding that the birds use numerous routes to numerous final destinations. And even peregrines that are thought not to migrate, are also being found."

"Archeologists are undermining theory that a prolonged dry spell in late 1200's drove the Anasazi, the ancestors of today's pueblo Indians, from their stone villages at Mesa Verde and elsewhere on Colorado Plateau; evidence suggests that drought may have been only the last straw for a people suffering from internecine war and possibly a religious crisis as divisive as European medieval heresies; map (M) ","Belying the popular image of the Anasazi as a peaceable kingdom of farmers and potters, some of the new research puts the blame for the collapse on a bloody internecine war. In some scenarios, the Anasazi were pulled farther south en masse by an attractive new religion. Many archeologists long complained that the Great Drought story seemed a little too pat. An assumption built into Dr. Van West's model was that the Anasazi could simply move to new plots nearby whenever the land they were working became too dry. Once the uprooted Anasazi arrived in their new homes, they apparently embraced a variety of new beliefs. Anthropologists are fairly sure that these new organizations were not imported by the Anasazi but sprang up after their arrival."

The soprano Hei-Kyung Hong, the soloist in Mozart's'' Exsultate, jubilate,'' sang this popular work with bright, clear tone and lyrical phrasing. In general, the orchestra playing was routine at best.

Russell Baker Op-Ed article disputes assertion by Bob Dole at Republican National Convention that things were better back in good old days (M) ,"Children, believe me: Things were not better in the old days. Don't let him kid you; Bob Dole remembers all this too. Midwestern farmers, left destitute in the Dust Bowl, became dirt-poor stoop labor in California. Dole is too good to peddle nostalgic bushwah about the good old days. Elderly folk who yearn publicly for the good old days must always be approached with caution. The Republican purpose, of course, is to spread the idea that the good old days have given way to bad new days created by Democrats. Thus Dole's speech lamented crime and drug use as new afflictions caused by President Clinton. They will doubtless vote for Dole and the return of those good old days."

But there is a further explanation, described in passing in a major new biography of Morris by the British writer Fiona MacCarthy. Offstage in all his houses were the servants. In 1891, when Britain had a population of 29 million, there were 2 million resident servants. In 1961, when the country's population was 46 million, there were only 102,000 live-in servants. For women much less so, since the management of families and servants was so time-consuming and complicated that a famous manual ( Beeton's ) was devoted to it.

Alan S Binder Op-Ed article questions decision by Bob Dole to make across-the board tax cut centerpiece of his Presidential campaign; drawing (M) ,"The big tax cuts increased the deficit rather than economic growth. History has already rendered its verdict on supply-side economics, which holds that large tax cuts can substantially increase economic growth. Real growth. And the tax cuts played a role by raising consumer spending. The unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent in the recession year of 1983 and 5.5 percent in the peak year of 1990. Growth over this 11-year period averaged only about 2.6 percent. We can also use a common economic rule of thumb to measure this 1983 to 1990 growth rate. Sustainable growth in the 1980's was about 2.5 percent-- the same as, or even lower than, it had been before the big tax cuts.

Such a decision would be made by the party's top leaders before a congress to be held next year. The current Chinese campaign does not lead to an election, but it will climax little more than 12 months from now with the 15th Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party."

Alan Riding reports on exhibition of work of Alberto Giacometti on view at Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh; photo (M) ,"And he could well have added drawing and printmaking to his brother's talents because, just as Alberto Giacometti was variously linked to Cubism, Surrealism and existentialism, he was equally at home with all forms of visual art. The defining feature of the major Giacometti exhibition currently at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art is that it presents the complete artist. There is no attempt to challenge the prevailing view that Giacometti's most original work was as a sculptor. The following year, Giacometti did his first sculpture, a small bust of Diego. To my terror, the sculptures became smaller and smaller,'' Giacometti later recalled. Yet, like many artists, he felt dissatisfied with his work, frequently noting that he found living beings more interesting than art."

James Digiacomo letter on speculation about whether Tiger Woods will leave Stanford University to pursue pro golf career (S) ,"To the Editor;You report ( Sports, Aug. 19 ) that some say Tiger Woods should abandon his quest for a degree, leave college early and turn pro because he is going to be a professional golfer, not an accountant. This equates higher education with job training. The college experience, especially at a superior institution like Stanford, is also about exploring ideas, appreciating literature and the arts, developing communication and social skills and becoming a more interesting and cultivated human being. If Mr. Woods is at Stanford just to work on his stroke, he should leave. But if he is there to get an education in the larger sense, I hope he stays. JAMES DI GIACOMONew York, Aug. 20, 1996"

In the high, quavery but resolute voice of a bemused wraith, Mr. Young sang about friends lost to heroin, in 20-year-old songs that could apply to rock's latest wave of addiction.

Reeves is hardly the most obsessive coach New York has had. New York is not really a football town, but on Sundays, if the Giants fail to make a first down the first time they handle the ball, people who have had season tickets in their family since the days of Tuffy Leemans will boo the living daylights out of either the quarterback or the coach, or sometimes both."

Ray Hannon letter scores Amtrak's decision to eliminate trains on three Western routes (S) ,"To the Editor: Amtrak's decision to eliminate trains on three Western routes, including the vital Chicago-to-Texas service, had little to do with either declining ridership or air competition as your Aug. 16 news article suggests. Few travelers can work their plans around such irregular trains. As Amtrak admits, a tri-weekly train is hardly better than no train at all. Your suggestion that trains are too slow for people in a hurry overlooks the fact that trains historically draw high ridership from connecting major terminals to intermediate cities and towns where there is little or no airline service. Amtrak should be reminded that it was created by Congress to run passenger trains; to have no other purpose than to carry more and more passengers; and to be a national system serving as much of America as possible."

Why Cognitive Therapy?Cognitive therapy is, in most cases, a short-term treatment that can have long-term results. That alone suggests that cognitive therapy will enjoy an ever-widening role in the treatment of emotional disorders. Jacobson's experience with cognitive therapy is hardly unique. Cognitive therapy is also proving useful for patients with chronic or recurring pain. A cognitive therapist directs a patient's attention to'' automatic'' thoughts, the things people say to themselves, that result in unpleasant feelings.

Please Kill Me,'' assembled by two people who were at the center of New York's mid-1970's punk scene. To the authors, punk traces one clear path through popular music. To the surprise of all concerned, a New York in-joke catches on overseas. Overnight, punk had become as stupid as everything else.'' But it does n't, and perhaps it ca n't, explain the punks' lasting impact."

"Editorial says sluggish start of Pres Clinton's new commission on airline safety and security gives scant hope that it will provide kind of muscle needed to protect passengers from terrorists; says that whatever recommendations it may make, commission must find way to keep pressure on reform (M) ","The sluggish start of President Clinton's new commission on airline safety and security gives scant hope that it will provide the kind of muscle needed to protect passengers from terrorists. The President, after meeting on July 25 with the families of those who lost their lives on Trans World Airlines Flight 800, was quick to announce that Vice President Gore would head a new commission to look at security threats and the broader issue of aviation safety. Unless its purpose is solely cosmetic, the new commission has an opportunity to apply high-level pressure in an area where past reform efforts have been blunted.

Corporate bond market is booming as issuers find lenders eager to ignore credit risk for higher returns; zero-coupon junk bonds are selling at fastest pace in years; junk bond mutual funds are taking in cash at record rates (M) ,"More and more, as the deals got screwier, those junk bonds paid no cash interest for the first several years. The guarantees included items like promises that interest rates would be raised as high as was necessary for the bonds to trade at face value. Companies that had trouble paying low interest rates got into worse trouble if rates were raised. Zero-coupon bonds became zero-return bonds, since investors got no money from interest payments before disaster struck. For more conventional junk bonds, the most important fact is that junk bond mutual funds are taking in cash this year at record rates. That loan has a variety of protections for Credit Suisse, in the form of increased interest rates and collateral, if the bond rating is cut to junk."

Peter Passell economic scene article discusses shift in rationale of mainstream economists for opposing regulation; cites view of Peter Pitsch that likely benefits in taming corporate power pale beside costs in delaying and distorting innovation; drawing (M) ,"IT is hardly news that mainstream economists think regulation often does more harm than good. The new critique of regulation is quite different. At its very best, the argument goes, regulation works by preventing monopolists from pushing prices above costs and reasonable profits. Until last year, Washington assigned specific uses to the radio spectrum-- television, radio, cellular phones-- and gave away the right to use it to companies deemed most worthy. Mr. Pitsch is rightly critical of Japan's premature commitment to a standard for high-definition television that was obsolete before the first sets were sold. More important, it is a painless introduction to the way economists are now rethinking regulation."

"Welfare bill that Pres Clinton is expected to sign creates such complicated questions for states that New York officials have yet to determine how much Federal aid state will lose, even after spending five weeks studying legislation; preliminary estimates by city and Federal officials suggest that New York City stands to lose $290 million a year because of one provision that eliminates welfare benefits for legal immigrants who are not American citizens; financial effect of legislation is causing concern in other states as well (M) ","But a state task force assigned to measure the effect of the legislation has yet to determine how many legal immigrants are on the welfare rolls statewide because such data has never been collected before.

If so, how?*Should states provide benefits for legal immigrants now that the Federal Government will no longer cover these people?*And But it is far from clear how many states will keep such programs going and how many will simply embrace the bill's provisions.
