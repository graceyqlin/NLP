Dole began a speech in West Hills, a section of Los Angeles, with a tribute to the city's latest hero, Hideo Nomo, the Dodger pitcher who threw a no-hitter against the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field in Denver on Tuesday night.

But the measure bogged down in the Senate when several senators wanted to include their own projects. Alan Front, a vice president of The Trust for Public Land, said the Sterling Forest plan may fare better as a minor part of an omnibus spending bill because lawmakers do not want to see Government services shut down again this year."

Matthew Stern letter responds to Sept 18 editorial opposing decision to keep Ross Perot out of Presidential debates ,"To the Editor: Concerning the misguided decision to keep Ross Perot out of the Presidential debates, you are right ( editorial, Sept. 18 ): the American political process suffers dearly from ideological confinement because of the entrenched interests of our two major parties. If the American people's judgment is irrelevant to the way in which their country is run, who needs to stimulate their minds with alternative opinions that might rock the boat?Accordingly, David S. Birdsell's attempt to justify the recommendation by the Commission on Presidential Debates to bar Mr. Perot ( Op-Ed, Sept. 18 ) should be disturbing to anyone who cherishes self-government: the'' majority of Americans,'' perhaps, whom Mr. Birdsell cites as favoring Mr. Perot's inclusion."

Birdsell ( Op-Ed, Sept. 18 ) sets forth reasons for the decision to exclude Ross Perot from the Presidential debates. The central reason is that Mr. Perot has no realistic chance of winning the election or a single state. Perot is on the ballot in all 50 states and has the resources and the organization to run a competitive race in most of those states. A better way of determining inclusion in the debates would be whether or not a candidate has the ability to run an effective race in a majority of states and whether or not such a national campaign will have a substantial impact on the outcome of the race.

Kenneth Harris letter responds to Sept 17 editorial on baseball pennant races ,"To the Editor: Your Sept. 17 editorial comparing today's baseball pennant races with those of yesteryear errs in one respect: that community loyalty is shattered by the shuffling of squads carried out by team owners between seasons. The pennant and cellar race rosters of many teams, particularly in small markets like Pittsburgh, often bear little resemblance to the lineups in April. The players I rooted for in May are playing against my team in September. Notwithstanding free agency, luxury boxes and new'' traditional'' stadiums, the only hope for the return of fan loyalty in baseball is to outlaw trading after the first 30 or so days of the season and to compel owners to rely through the World Series on their farm teams for replacement players when injury or poor performance disqualifies the regulars."
John Uniack Davis letter responds to Sept 17 editorial on baseball pennant races ,"To the Editor: You assert ( editorial, Sept. 17 ) that baseball owners like George Steinbrenner and Peter Angelos'' play the market so fast they neglect the importance of identity and continuity.''

Mr. Angelos was the only owner to refuse to field replacement players during the 1994- 95 strike, preferring that fans get to see the major leaguers they paid to see and because he did n't want to disrupt Cal Ripken's pursuit of Lou Gehrig's consecutive-games-played record.

Miss Mutter offered us the big accent, the prominent sliding portamento, the big vibrato in the slow movement, the noticeably elongated tempo after the first movement cadenza, the fearless attacks on the finale's double notes. The Tchaikovsky was the Fourth Symphony.

Letter from Robert Wieland says bipartisan commission decision to deny Ross Perot seat in Presidential debates was correct (S) ,"Perot has not established himself as a vital force in America politics. Perot and his party claim to be a grass-roots movement, but very few from his party have sought election as a member of Congress, governor or state legislator.

If Mr. Perot wants to be considered a serious contender for the Presidency it might be prudent to build his party from the grass roots. Once it has captured several seats in Congress and a few governorships, then he can start talking about a run for President.

Holland Cotter reviews artist Anton van Dalen show at Adam Baumgold Gallery (S) ,"128 East 72d Street Manhattan Mr. van Dalen, who was born in the Netherlands, was an integral part of the East Village art scene of the early 80's and represented its original, grass-roots spirit. His little colored-pencil drawing from 1985 of a burned-out car sitting on Avenue C in front of a Pentacostal church, its stained-glass windows glowing, is a classic image from that time. The recurrent images of birds, though, are what make this show a charmer. Mr. van Dalen still raises pigeons on the roof of his Lower East Side home, and his love for them is infectious."
Anna Kisselgoff reviews Rambert Dance Co program at Joyce Theater (M) ,"An allegory inspired by the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, vignettes inspired by Bob Dylan and an animated but oblique meditation on the human condition: the sum makes up the Rambert Dance Company's second program at the Joyce Theater, the best seen so far. Created for the 1995 United We Dance Festival, sponsored by the San Francisco Ballet to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the United Nations,'' Meeting Point'' is nonetheless more than a piece d'occasion. Mr. Bruce introduces the communal round of universal folk dance, but with a twist. The Rambert Dance Company is to perform at the Joyce, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, through Sept. 29.DANCE REVIEW"
"A M Rosenthal Op-Ed column scores double standard about Middle East, in which Israel is criticized but Syria moves with seeming impunity; says Pres Hafez el-Assad of Syria has shown himself ready to escalate risk of war, moving commando brigade and division headquarters close to Israel and Israeli communications, but no government has denounced Syria and Pres Clinton has done little more than send message urging restraint (M) ","Suppose Syria proposed to Israel that Hezbollah guerrillas would be removed by the Syrian Government from Lebanon's border zone with Israel. In return Israel would withdraw its troops from that same zone. Suppose Israel immediately rejected the Syrian proposal as a dirty trick to get Israel to sign a full peace with Syria, at the price of control of the Golan. The reaction against Israel would have made the earth tremble. First, the world press would have immediately attacked Israel for not even considering the important Syrian withdrawal initiative. He said Syria and Israel should resume talks in Washington, each side entitled to bring up anything, including the Golan. Then Syria moved a commando brigade and division headquarters closer to Israel and Israeli communications."
"Pope John Paul II arrives in Tours, France, on trip that has stirred old passions about role of Roman Catholic Church in French society; Pope tries to dampen debate with appeal to compassion and tolerance 'regardless of religious beliefs'; Pres Jacques Chirac helped refuel debate over separation of church and state when he referred to France as 'eldest daughter of the church'; he has since taken care to welcome Pope in name of 'republican and secular France' (M) ","But the debate over the Pope's trip went far beyond the arcane historical issue of Clovis to a vehement argument over the place of the Roman Catholic Church in France today. Today, the Pope was greeted by modest but enthusiastic crowds and guarded by an estimated 6,000 police officers, bodyguards and marksmen."

Sumitomo said the losses had grown to $ 2.6 billion, 44 percent beyond the $ 1.8 billion estimate released in June, because it had to close out complex trading positions created by Mr. Hamanaka.

"Editorial says Congress must find fairer, more balanced way to endow Amtrak; says country owes itself the preservation of this hard-earned national resource; agrees with Sen Trent Lott that what is needed is national rail passenger system, not patchwork of local routes tied together by legislators performing constituent service ","Key senators want to transfer to the National Highway Trust Fund some $ 5 billion a year in gas tax revenues that have been reserved for budget reduction and apply a small slice of that-- perhaps $ 600 million a year-- to Amtrak. That is too high a price to pay for the small amount Amtrak would get, especially in these times of budget stress when so many worthy causes have far less funding than the highways. Where Amtrak has dropped trains and reduced service, several states have scraped up funds to fill the gap, but other strapped states have been unable to. Meanwhile, Amtrak's route curtailment program is causing political as well as consumer distress. Surely he and other awakened lawmakers can devise a way to save Amtrak without pumping excess money into highways."

Editorial says Bosnia's national elections represent imperfect but valuable step away from the horror of ethnic slaughter; stresses need for United States and its European allies to continue threat of sanctions against Serbia and Croatia should they encourage separatism or other violations of Dayton peace accord ,"Bosnia's national elections last weekend were only a first, flawed step toward creating new democratic institutions in that war-torn country. Sometime soon Western election monitors, led by Ambassador Robert Frowick of the United States, must decide whether to certify the election results. Once the election is certified, the Dayton peace agreement permits, but does not require, the United Nations Security Council to revoke international trade sanctions against Serbia. These sanctions were suspended late last year. The sanction threat should remain in place to pressure Belgrade and its Bosnian Serb allies to honor their other obligations under the peace agreement. Regrettably, Serbia's friends in the Security Council seem determined to lift these standby sanctions once the election has been certified. These elections, like the Dayton peace agreement itself, were no victory for idealism."

"Four major broadcast television networks--ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox--along with newcomers UPN and WB are spending $400 million to $500 million as each tries to create distinctive identity through advertising effort known as branding; branding is shorthand term used along Madison Avenue for attempts to create or burnish an image or identity; efforts are most ambitious drive yet by broadcast networks to brand themselves and many of blocks of prgramming they offer--marked departure from past, when they would only promote specific shows; to that end, each network is stacking its schedules with programs meant to appeal to certain types of viewers; drawings; table (L) ","To push those brand identities, the six networks have all assembled a slew of slogans and elaborate promotional campaigns. Networks like CNN, ESPN and MTV have drawn viewers almost as much for their catchy branding promotions as for their focused programming. NBC, which won the ratings race for the 1995- 96 season, was the only large network to have increased viewership from the 1994- 95 season. CBS is so busily branding that the network has been the object of pointed jokes on two of its own shows. About the only come-on that's missing, it seems, is an offer of a job branding a network for next year."

Not only is the Mayor the author of the nation's biggest workfare program, but his administration has long urged the transit agency to begin using welfare workers. The new transit contract, by making the connection between attrition and workfare so much more immediate and obvious, threatens to undermine the delicate understanding between the city and its unions. Many unions have already expressed concern that the bill does not protect them from the kind of action proposed by the transit agency: reducing a unionized work force through attrition, then using workfare for the same kind of work."

Only after their son ( Edward Furlong ) is accused of murdering his girlfriend do Carolyn ( Meryl Streep ) and Ben Ryan ( Liam Neeson ) realize that they hardly know the boy at all. Adapted from Rosellen Brown's emotionally charged novel about a family in crisis, Barbet Schroeder's film fits his chillier style by effectively treating the crime but never really probing the family dynamic. Ben, a sculptor, is the impetuous sort, intent on defending his son. As Carolyn, a pragmatic pediatrician, Ms. Streep never gets comfortable, perhaps because, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,'' Schroeder's detached directorial style does n't suit the film's strained home and hearth scenes.''"

Excerpt from campaign address delivered by Bob Dole (S) ,"I believe that some in the news media are missing a very important story. Not the political story-- that's covered. Not about Bob Dole and Bill Clinton or anyone else, on drugs. But the countless stories, personal tragedies that have become a social crisis.''Consider a fact. In 1989, evening network television news ran 518 anti-drug stories. By 1995, with drug use rising dramatically that number had fallen to 101 stories. It is my view that soaring drug use, drug abuse, and the resurgence of a drug culture is one of the important news stories of out time.

"Russell Baker Op-Ed column on seeming demise of the old-fashioned political reporter, who is quickly being replaced by public opinion polls (M) ","The old-fashioned political reporter is going the way of the chestnut tree. Nowadays the only political reporting that gets any attention-- including attention from old-fashioned political reporters-- is public opinion polls. Should political reporters quit too? This is why conservationists are urging the White House to hurry up and select a political reporter who can be declared a national monument. I happen to know about this because the White House Commission on a National Old-Fashioned Political Reporter Monument has asked me to suggest a candidate for monumenthood. Here is television's argument: The talking-head TV shows produced in Washington every weekend require at least three old-fashioned political reporters per show. Television's argument is obviously self-serving, but it does seem unfair to a once-honorable trade to have only one old-fashioned political reporter declared a national monument."

The requirements will probably increase the demand for health maintenance organizations and other health plans that control costs by managing care, especially mental health care. Hewlett-Packard now has a lifetime limit of $ 1 million on health benefits for any employee or dependent, with a separate limit of $ 300,000 on mental health care.

Nor could Warde, who died in 1935, have anticipated Shakespeare's status with the mass American audience in 1996."

There are rumors, however, that Mr. Politi is responsible for much of the biography, with Mr. Bernstein concentrating on the long chapter that expands a 1992 Time magazine cover story asserting that Pope John Paul II formed a close working alliance with the C.I.A. to bring down the Communist Government in Poland. Tuesday evening's conversation with Mr. Politi did not focus on these issues, however, but on the Pope's legacy to the church and what would come next. But Mr. Politi believes that the church faces deeper problems than the ones that often divide conservatives and progressives. Mr. Politi added.'"

"Editorial says New York's Court of Appeals should take up recent decision by four-judge appellate panel, which found that 15-year-old student should not have been suspended in 1992 for carrying loaded weapon to Bronx high school, since gun was found during illegal search ","The setting this time is a New York City public school. A state appeals court ruled this week that a 15-year-old student should not have been suspended in 1992 for carrying a loaded weapon to a Bronx high school, since the gun was found during an illegal search. The case is important for New York, and for other cities plagued with school violence. Properly carried out, this is a sound standard that gives school security guards ample leeway to conduct reasonable searches. In a recent student search case, New York's Court of Appeals seemed to be leaning toward giving school guards greater leeway to look for weapons, taking into account such things as the need to get guns out of schools and the actual intrusiveness of a given search."
"Editorial urges passage of compromise worked out by Sens Patrick Leahy and Mark Hatfield on important foreign aid program dealing with family planning; they would set aid at $385 million for 1997, and private organizations receiving American Government support would be required to certify that funds would not be used to promote abortion ","The House, driven by American abortion politics, seems ready to undermine programs that have proved effective in reducing population growth abroad. It favors a measure that would reduce international family planning aid to any organization that condones abortion. Clinton's policy conforms with American law, which does not allow Federal funds to be used for abortion. Federal support for international family planning declined sharply this year, and the House proposes to freeze it next year at the same level, $ 356 million. The House would also require a 50 percent cut in funding for any international organization that provides abortions, encourages them or supports more lenient abortion laws in a foreign country. They would set family planning aid at $ 385 million for 1997, but postpone disbursement of funds until February."

"Editorial says 1991 Truth in Savings Act requires banks to advertise yields on deposit accounts in identical fashion so customers can instantly compare one bank's offering with another; says this important protection for bank customers should be retained in larger bank bill under consideration, and Pres Clinton should warn that he would veto bill that strips consumers of this well-designed protection ","House and Senate negotiators will decide soon whether to gut an important protection for bank customers. The 1991 Truth in Savings Act requires banks to advertise yields on deposit accounts in identical fashion so that customers can instantly compare one bank's offering with another. The provision forces banks to compete honestly for customers by offering attractive interest rates. The proposed rollback is part of a larger bank bill designed to shore up the fund that insures deposits at savings and loan institutions. The high premiums, in turn, are driving many savings institutions to turn themselves into commercial banks, sapping the fund of cash. Banks offer customers a bewildering variety of deposits."

"North Carolina coast struggles to recover from Hurricane Fran, which devastated popular vacation spots earlier this month (S) ","Kennedy's lament can be heard throughout the booming tourism industry in coastal North Carolina, which was slammed by Hurricane Fran on Sept. 5, less than two months after a lesser hurricane, named Bertha, came ashore in almost the same place. In popular vacation spots like Carolina Beach, Wrightsville Beach and Topsail Beach along the state's southern coast, large numbers of motels and houses were demolished and the fall tourist season was instantly suspended. The best prediction offered by Paul J. Cook, a spokesman for the North Carolina travel and tourism division, was that'' we should be O.K. by springtime.'' The North Carolina coast, known as the'' graveyard of the Atlantic,'' is a popular diving area because of its more than 1,200 shipwrecks.''Our shop totally flooded,''"

When shopping, we'd somehow wind up in the local outlet of the European chain Prenatal, drawn to the hip baby clothes and furniture decades ahead of America's pastel polyester. But we did purchase baby lotions, powders and soaps from old farmaccias, and some booties. After browsing through countless beautiful paper stores, I bought a green leather notebook, illustrated with etchings of all the palaces of the Grand Canal, and started keeping a baby journal. And we were unduly fond of the city's subway equivalent, the tortoise-slow vaporetto boats that cruise the Grand Canal."

David Papineau reviews book Full House: The Spread of Excellence From Plato to Darwin by Stephen Jay Gould; drawing (L) ,"By Stephen Jay Gould. At first sight, it may seem obvious that natural selection makes life progress toward increasing complexity. True, the average complexity of species has undoubtedly increased since bacteria ruled the earth, and this in itself might seem to show that natural selection favors increased complexity. An increase in average complexity would still result even if natural selection is merely moving species around at random from a starting point of minimum bacterial complexity. But Mr. Gould thinks there is good empirical evidence against this. Instead Mr. Gould argues that an overall improvement in standards has shrunk the space available for outstanding hitters to outstrip this mean batting average. Just as in baseball, overall standards in cricket have undoubtedly improved through this century, but this has n't led to any systematic fall-off in the top batting averages."

Rockefeller, whose vision of public higher education is embodied in this arts-oriented branch of the State University, left the Governor's office to become Vice President of the United States. Rockefeller was not only personally passionate about the arts-- serving as a trustee of both the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art-- but he also dared to establish a public college devoted to cultivating arts education at the highest level. If we could pull it off, it would be unique in higher education in the public sector, and maybe even in the private,'' said Bill Lacy, the college's current president."

Paine accomplished this in his capacity as chairman of Waterbury's Parking Authority over the objections of people who tried to save the building by promoting alternative ways to provide additional parking. The parking garage that was built on that site is absolutely soul-less, one of the ugliest buildings I've ever seen."
"Municipal officials across Connecticut are concerned that liability costs of public recreation may skyrocket as result of July 25 State Supreme Court decision, that overturned decision it made in 1992 case, and allowed woman right to sue Wilton for injury she incurred in high school tennis match 10 years ago; decision also stripped Connecticut's towns and cities from their immunity from personal injury lawsuits involving public recreation; some towns have reacted by curtailing their sponsorship of riskier sports in in public parks in order to reduce their liability; Connecticut Conference of Municipalities says it will propose legislation next year to restore immunity from lawsuits for cities and towns (M) ","The decision also stripped Connecticut's towns and cities from their immunity from personal injury lawsuits involving public recreation. The act, passed in 1971, granted immunity from liability to land owners who provide their land without cost to municipalities for public recreational use. But municipalities argue that the immunity also applied to them, and in 1992, in the case Manning v. Barenz, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that it did. Since then, he said, the legislature has defeated three attempts by the Trial Lawyers Association to remove municipality liability immunity from the Recreational Land Use Act. He admitted he was surprised by the court's legal reinterpretation of the recreation land use act in the Conway decision."

For starters, Mr. Mehta gets the tempos right-- at least half the battle in this symphony, which runs nearly 80 minutes, the epic finale alone almost half an hour. Whereas most performances ( including some much-admired recordings ) impose a certain ponderousness on the opening movement, marked by the ambivalent'' Allegro energico, ma non troppo,'' Mr. Mehta pushes it a bit. A similarly charged finale exudes brilliance without declining into mere slickness. End to end, the orchestra spins out a performance of arresting light and shadow, concentration and urgency."

How does a public figure protect himself from slander without compromising his spiritual values? It is true that I have suggested in my book'' The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success'' that the best tactic is defenselessness.

In both camps, the self-obsessed will have a tough time of it.

Flexibility and moderation-- on the part of conservatives and liberals alike-- are the qualities that will enable us to meet today's social and economic challenges. America is fortunate that it has for the most part maintained only two parties rather than splintering into a fractious, multiparty system that polarizes and divides, sometimes irreconcilably.

Journalist Anthony Quinn reviews book Father and Son by Larry Brown; drawing (L) ,"FATHER AND SON By Larry Brown. Chapel Hill, N.C.: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill.

Glen is a young man hot out of prison, having done three years for manslaughter. He works on a perilously short fuse and an awfully long memory: within hours of his homecoming he has shot dead an old enemy at a bar in the next county and raped a young woman. All that Glen seems to have inherited from the old man is an alcohol problem.

Co-op shareholders in New York City and their boards regularly deal with issues such as allowing pets in never-ending effort to maintain balance between shareholders' personal rights and sometimes conflicting responsibilities of community living; case of Giselle Masson's right to keep her two dogs in her apartment discussed; drawing (L) ,"IF Gisele Masson did n't own one of New York City's best-known French restaurants, her ongoing dispute with the board of her Manhattan co- op would probably have received little attention. Masson's case is illustrative of how a reasonable board can apply a reasonable rule against a reasonable shareholder with results that appear entirely unreasonable. The second prong relates to'' selective enforcement'' of the rule by the board. While any one of the above allegations, if proved, could be grounds for defeating the eviction, the co-op board disputes all three. Peter Axelrod, the lawyer for the board, said that the co-op board acted as soon as it discovered that the pet was in the apartment and that the no-pet rule itself had been in the proprietary lease since the building's conversion."
