He is fatigued, he has scant confidence and he would be a detrimental starter.''It was n't one of his better games,'' said Manager Joe Torre, who, curiously, said Gooden was still in contention for a post-season start.'' But Gooden's laborious 98-pitch fiasco tonight after one week of rest should erase him from any of the four starting spots. Gooden is 1- 2 with a 5.71 e.r.a. versus Texas. Torre cited Cone's experience in selecting him over Andy Pettitte, a 21-game winner who will pitch two innings Saturday and start in Game 2.''The experience, you ca n't buy that,''"
"North Korea warns that rising tensions over grounding of its submarine off South Korea might lead to war, and it suggests that it might have to attack South (M) ","The dispute broke out on Sept. 18 when a 325-ton North Korean submarine ran aground in South Korea. It is believed that 26 North Koreans slipped ashore, armed with sidearms and machine guns, some disguised in South Korean military uniforms.

We drove up from Lake Tahoe early in the morning, a convoy of 10 Jeep Wranglers ready to drive the toughest nine-mile section of the trail in to Rubicon Springs. But there was still an element of the absurd: I could have walked the Rubicon Trail in a third of the time it took to drive it.

"Huge outbreak of wildfires in West this year leads ecologists to recomment 'prescribed burns,' low-level fires that recreate natural cleansing effect of ancient fires; environmentalists point out that fire suppression and logging of big trees have led to ferocious burning of smaller trees that remain; map (S) ","Ignited by lightning or by Indians, fires swept through forests about every 15 years. Fire crawled along the forest floor, cleaning out the clutter of dead branches, shrubs and low trees. Without regular low-level fires, Western forests grew dense, and massive amounts of fuel built up. Racing from tree crown to tree crown, fires last longer and travel farther. This summer, 219,000 acres burned in one Idaho fire, 155,350 acres burned in a Nevada fire, and 135,000 acres burned in a Utah fire. To restore fire to the forest, ecologists advocate'' prescribed burns''-- or low-level fires that recreate the natural, cleaning effect of ancient fires."

What about the victims' rights Almost all states have their victim services programs run primarily out of the executive branch. No victim advocate should tell the victim what he or she should or should not do. So I do n't think the victims' movement is really as monolithic and single-minded as some believe.

Music of chance made a ripple among the avant-garde a generation ago, but Ives's disruptions a half-century earlier followed their own sonic rules: the rules of listening to a parade. The rules of harmony may have been broken in Ives's music but never the rules of the parade. Scholars deal aptly with Ives's American and European connections."

"William Zimmer reviews exhibition Keiji Shinohara: Interpretations in Woodcut, at Wesleyan University Davison Art Center in Middletown, Conn; photos (M) ","According to custom, these prints have been the work of three people: an artist, a carver and a printer. Besides offering a small survey of Mr. Shinohara's own recent work, the exhibition features woodcuts by other artists with whom he has collaborated, translating their distinctive idioms into woodcuts. Some of the artists with whom Mr. Shinohara has worked in making woodcuts specialize in geometry, so building a composition out of several blocks seems a natural extension of their thinking. Whether it's in behemoth paintings or in smaller works in paper, the Irish-born American artist Sean Scully restricts himself to stripes, bars and blocks in movingly inventive and Expressionist combinations.

"Asia is producing increasing amount of contemporary art that deals with complex questions of racial and national identity; shows that will be presented in US, including Contemporary Art in Asia: Traditions/Tensions at Asia Society, Queens Museum of Art and Grey Art Gallery of New York University, discussed; exhibit, organized by Asia Society, focuses on art from Indonesia, India, the Philippines, South Korea and Thailand; photos (L) ","'' CONTEMPORARY ART IN INDIA? THERE IS NO contemporary art in India.'' How could an avant-garde art exist anywhere in the'' timeless'' cultures of what we monolithically call Asia? The Guggenheim show will include new work from China. Thus, superficially considered, the new Asian art risks being dismissed either as wannabe Western or inauthentically Asian. Comparable images in mainstream contemporary art in New York tend to inspire condescension or discomfort. Contemporary Asian art, by contrast, is as often as protective of history as it is skeptical. But it is evident in other Asian art forms-- from religious painting to modernist abstraction to traditional work-- unrepresented here. And its new art will be a provocative part of our future."
"New York City has rarely revealed itself so outspokenly as it does in assortment of 20 features and two programs of historic shorts that constitute The Silent City: New York in the Movies, 1898-1929 at Film Forum in Manhattan; photo (L) ","But the New York shown in these early silents seems especially pure and unposed. In this 1928 film, a bawdy dance hall is the trysting place for a ship's stoker and a New York woman of the streets. According to Mr. Goldstein, three themes emerge in these silent films: tenement life, the life of Broadway show people and the Wall Street whirl. And there are films about New York immigrants that look like Jacob Riis photographs come to life. The recently rediscovered film was restored by the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive, and this screening may be the first one in New York in 80 years. Oddly, because of American copyright regulations, more history survives from this early film era than from later ones."

Vincent Canby reviews play Skylight by David Hare; photo (L) ,"It's a snowy winter evening, and if Tom and Kyra have a lot to catch up on, they have even more to thrash out. Kyra did n't hesitate to make love to Tom as long as Alice did n't know. Kyra obviously is a suitable case for treatment. There's a touch of condescension in the way Tom and Kyra attack each other. Tom and Kyra have wit but not much humor. No one more so than Mr. Gambon. While Tom seduces Kyra, the actor seduces the audience. Gambon's immense control as an actor seeps into the character to such an extent that Tom comes to control the play as well, which is actually more about Kyra than it is about Tom."
"Johannes Brahms, who died 100 years ago next April, will be celebrated throughout the season, beginning with Berlin Philharmonic's performances at Carnegie Hall this week; how Brahms grappled with issues of a century ago through his music discussed; drawing (L) ","The philosopher Ernst Bloch was perhaps the first to defend Brahms's modernism on broader cultural grounds. Brahms's Vienna was that of the cultural opposition: the liberal, modernist, anti-imperial Vienna of the Protestant and Jewish middle classes, which had risen to political and cultural prominence in the liberal 1860's. For Brahms, highly sophisticated in matters of musical history, Mozart was a fellow modernist. What one finds in Brahms's music from here on is something new and different: the transformation of a music of grace into a music of consolation. Brahms's music first desires and then provides a deep consoling presence, which emerges explicitly in the'' German Requiem.'' It is a cultural achievement as well as a musical one."

Not a few Texas ranches boast spinster-dominatrix sisters, some of whom have succeeded in driving off not one but a succession of wives.

For instance, I found Mr. Furgurson's careful account of the Union Army's actual entry into Richmond, a subject full of doubt and dispute, especially helpful.

Schools like University used to be known as'' private,'' meaning both exclusive and free to discriminate. Whether University School succeeds perfectly, or demonstrates the superiority of single-sex education for boys, is unimportant; a book as well written, convincingly reported and readable as'' Boys Themselves'' does n't also have to provide definitive answers.

Katha Pollitt letter on Phillip Lopate Sept 8 article Sans Teeth on state of poetry in America (M) ,"To the Editor: In his insightful discussion of poetic cliches ('' Sans Teeth,'' Sept. 8), Phillip Lopate forgot to mention the monologue by the oppressed woman artist of the past ( Frida Kahlo, Emily Dickinson, Camille Claudel ); the poem nostalgically recounting baseball or basketball games of the poet's youth; the weird Southern childhood poem; and what I call the CNN poem, which retells in overheated free verse a prominent news story involving war, famine, torture, child abuse or murder. This saves a lot of bother all around, and enables poet and reader to drowse together in a warm bath of mutual admiration for each other's capacity for deep feeling and right thinking."
Joel Conarroe letter on Denis Donoghue Sept 15 review of Angela's Ashes: A Memoir by Frank McCourt (S) ,"To the Editor: Denis Donoghue does a fine job of summarizing Frank McCourt's'' Angela's Ashes'' ( Sept. 15 ), and his comments about his own childhood are engaging. Perhaps, though, because a peculiarly Irish kind of vernacular poetry and sly taletelling are part of his heritage, and as such are taken pretty much for granted, he does not give potential readers a sense of just how laugh-out-loud funny a good deal of Mr. McCourt's memoir is. Much of the material, to be sure, is heartbreaking, but Mr. McCourt, who has clearly kissed the Blarney stone, is an irrepressibly comic raconteur, and it is as much for the high-spirited comedy as for the eloquent depictions of deprivation that I found his book irresistible.

Sherman L Greene letter on Neil A Lewis Sept 8 review of William N Eskridge Jr's book The Case for Same-Sex Marriage: From Sexual Liberty to Civilized Commitment (S) ,"The Case for Same-Sex Marriage: From Sexual Liberty to Civilized Commitment'' ( Sept. 8), Neil A. Lewis writes,'' Eskridge starts with a premise that is obvious to all but some homosexual advocates: Gay men tend to be ( gasp! ) more promiscuous than straight men and may even have an unhealthy interest in young men.''Even assuming it to be true, which it is not, that gay men are more interested in young men than straight men are in young women , to believe that either of these interests ( which are really the same interest in youthful pulchritude and vulnerability ) is unhealthy is to make a value judgment. Value judgments, by definition, can not be obvious. This one, for instance, is a thoughtless prejudice masquerading as conventional wisdom."

I refused to turn to the review of David Denby's'' Great Books: My Adventures With Homer, Rousseau, Woolf, and Other Indestructible Writers of the Western World'' until I had figured out who was represented in the illustration. One figure, the vaguely medieval blond to the right ofthe words'' Alma Mater,'' stumped me. Imagine my surprise to find him identified as Virgil.

In five of these ten stories, his narrator is young Ramon de las Casas, called Yunior, whose father abandons his wife and children for years before returning to the Dominican Republic and bringing them back with him to New Jersey. In other stories, the nameless tellers may or may not be Yunior, but they're all young Latino men with the same well-defended sensitivity, uneasy relations with women and obsessive watchfulness.

Scott Veale reviews book Uncertainty by Michael Larsen (S) ,"UNCERTAINTY By Michael Larsen. The Danish writer Michael Larsen and his translators, Lone Thygesen Blecher and George Blecher, work hard to give'' Uncertainty'' a raw edge, but the book is, finally, a rather standard thriller, complete with such hoary conventions as the exploding cigarette and a final showdown that suffers from the villain-who-talks-too-much syndrome. Nevertheless, there are some interesting passages about the potential of computer technology to manipulate images ( thus seamlessly creating a parallel reality ), as well as a disturbing message about the dark side of our digital society:'' We live a godless existence with our new god."
Felicia Lee reviews book Sarah's Psalm by Florence Ladd (S) ,"By Florence Ladd. Scribner, $ 23.The enchantment of this first novel by Florence Ladd, the director of Radcliffe College's Bunting Institute, is in its exploration of a social set that's seldom portrayed in literature. The disappointment is in discovering that it reads like a good outline, with stilted dialogue and starchy exposition that fails to convey the richness and complexity of the characters. Sarah Stewart is a Harvard doctoral student in literature, a Wellesley graduate from a black bourgeois family who marries the boy next door, an M.I.T. graduate student with a similar pedigree. Sarah's Psalm'' is an entertaining novel that falters because we never get deep enough inside its main character, a young woman who is torn between her aspirations for a career and the lures of motherhood and marriage."
Malachy Duffy reviews book Dark Debts by Karen Hall (S) ,"DARK DEBTS By Karen Hall. Random House, $ 24.With demonic posession, a deadly hotel fire, satanic rituals, a fallen priest and visitations from Jesus as key elements, this first novel instantly casts a spell. If you can read past this section ( and ignore the continually annoying conceit of presenting the characters' interior monologues in italics ), then you'll be rewarded with the tale of the priest, Michael Kinney, and his struggle to save a poor Southern family from an unspeakable curse that has brought it to the edge of ruin. As Kinney unravels the secrets of this family's past, he collides with his own personal demon, hellbent on destroying him. The moments when Kinney confronts the demon are as gratifyingly chilling as an old-fashioned horror movie."

Hyperion, $ 22.95.American political history is peppered with examples of Presidents bemoaning the limitations of office and carping about inadequate powers, intractable problems or a vicious press. He proposes a more common-sense explanation: Presidential performance depends on the character of the man in office. Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt possessed qualities unavailable to mediocre Presidents like Millard Fillmore or Jimmy Carter. Unfortunately, these properties are so broad that they are as applicable to student-body presidents as to Presidents of the United States. Moreover, Mr. Dallek cites the same examples, sometimes even similar lists of Presidential accomplishments, in several chapters.''"

Looking back over this century, you realize that humanity is capable of being governed but largely incapable of governing itself. But any vision of the future that depends on the collective, interdependent self-governance of this species is essentially a delusion, for what most people contribute to their own governance is resignation.

Yet our understanding of the genetics of human disease does promise to transform medical practice. At one extreme are the diseases for which genetic knowledge will lead to successful treatment. With luck, more common genetic diseases-- cystic fibrosis and fragile X syndrome-- are also ruled out. That is what we can hope genetic technology will bring.

But with quantum systems, what you see is all you get. A wave is all over the place; a particle is in one place only. Are photons particles or waves? They are neither-- or they are both. The physics equations tell us that the two particles must have opposite spin: if one is'' spin up,'' the other must be'' spin down.'' So now we observe one particle and find, say, that it is spin up. We have thus'' resolved'' the spin state of a particle that allegedly had no such state until we made the observation.

Corn lacks wheat's gluten. It can not be kneaded like wheat to make an elastic yeast-risen dough. That explains the tortilla, a traditional bread made only of corn.

Joan Lee Faust Gardening column on joys of chrysanthemums in autumn; drawings (M) ,"TO every flower there is a season. At this time of year what could be more glorious than the chrysanthemum?For months these plants have been taking up space in the flower border just showing off their green leaves. Then flower buds form and soon the plant is transformed by a burst of bloom. Chrysanthemums come in ever so many colors. Chrysanthemum flower shows held at this time of year group the flowers in separate classes. Garden shops are resplendent now with pots of mums in tight bud or full bloom. As the plants grow, they are pinched three times a year to prevent them from forming straight stalks. If the plant is an early-blooming mum, then perhaps the last pinch should be eliminated since the flower buds will have formed or may even be open."

One early gathering place was Sandy Hook. A canoe race is to start in Red Bank at Oyster Point, so named because of the large pile of oyster shells that accumulated there from Lenape oystermen. The last Lenape gathering at Sandy Hook was shortly before 1678, when an English landowner paid the tribe 13 shillings to get off his land. Previously, members of the tribe lived in the area, building canoes from the 40-foot red cedar trees that once grew on the peninsula and eating prickly pears, which still grow there."

How can we find our way back?I think we start by accepting that risk is always present. By accepting risk as the price of freedom, we can reject the dubious argument that security measures that give the Government more power also reduce the threat of terrorism.

The role of the Internet in the schools must be examined more critically. Although a useful reference source, the Internet does not serve the functions of a textbook. It does not provide organization or overview. Much of what is available is advertising and public-relations handouts. Authorship is usually anonymous.

Market Watch column speculates about appeal of inflation-linked savings bonds (S) ,"Inflation bonds are coming. The bonds will prove to be a good buy if inflation rises, but not if inflation continues to decline. So popular were they that investors accepted a real yield of just 2.5 percent, and that figure soon declined as people passed up double-digit yields on normal bonds to buy protection from inflation. Since then, as inflation scares have eased, higher real yields have been needed to attract buyers. But those investors can, if they wish, buy inferior inflation protection now, in the form of investments like natural resources stocks. If the real yield does come in at a relatively high figure, these bonds are likely to be good investments."

What does the Government get in the deal?A. In return for inflation protection, the Treasury expects to pay investors a little less interest than it pays on regular bonds. Q. How exactly will the new bonds work?A. As with regular bonds, an investor lends the Government money, say $ 1,000, and the Government promises to pay interest on the loan of, say, 3.25 percent. The Government also promises to repay the borrowed money on a certain date; to begin, all the new bonds will mature in 10 years. The interest rate will remain fixed, but because the principal amount of the loan or bond is growing, the interest payments will be bigger."

Dusty Rhodes, the unlikely hero in the New York Giants' underdog sweep of the Cleveland Indians in the 1954 World Series, was asked whether his game-winning pinch home run in the first game inspired his teammates."
"Republican efforts to taint Pres Clinton with 'liberal' label discussed; Clinton did waver from centrist positions during first two years in White House, but has since returned to middle ground; photo; Prof Walter Dean Burnham notes that, after peeling away Richard Nixon's 'paranoia,' Nixon and Clinton are not so far apart; suggests Clinton is Eisenhower Republican, brought up to date (S) ","As for Mr. Clinton, he said,'' A real spend-and-tax liberal.'' So while the President might seem liberal next to Speaker Newt Gingrich, so might Mr. Dole, who has championed his share of tax increases over the years. There's nothing wrong with Bill Clinton being a liberal. The latest New York / Times CBS News Poll found that 43 percent perceive him as a liberal; 36 percent as a moderate and 12 percent as a conservative. Before the 1992 election, a Times / CBS survey found that 38 percent considered him a liberal, 37 percent a moderate and 13 percent a conservative. And 46 percent of liberals say Mr. Clinton is liberal. That's dangerously close to calling oneself a liberal, too. Who's a Liberal!"
Discovery of prehistoric carvings in northwestern Australia noted; photos (S) ,"They were anatomically modern Homo sapiens, the human species scientists think emerged in Africa 100,000 to 150,000 years ago. They are at least 15,000 years older than other Australian rock art, more than twice the age of the French cave paintings. But is it art? Archeologists must address this kind of question each time they explore deeper in the past, beyond the enchanting cave paintings of bison and horses in Europe that modern sensibility recognizes as art. To do otherwise, they say, would be anachronistic, since the notion of art as esthetic expression is modern. ' I like having a little poke at the conceit that only modern humans have art,'' she said. Perhaps art preceded modern humans."
"Outburst of Palestinian violence against Israel, following several months of tension and suspicion about intent of new Israeli Government, discussed; photos (S) ","Such a moment was the swearing in of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel on June 18. On the surface, it should not have been so major a shift: Mr. Netanyahu and his lieutenants insisted they were committed to the peace accords, the Palestinian homelands stayed quiet, the American Congress gave the new Prime Minister the requisite standing ovation. Yes, some Palestinian lands were confiscated, some building began in the settlements and some Arab leaders grumbled. What began as Palestinian rock-throwing escalated with astonishing speed into firefights between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian policemen. Many Israelis and Western leaders joined Mr. Arafat and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres in arguing that it was not the peace itself, but the efforts to stall or reverse it, that had led to the conflagration."

The Dole campaign has all but conceded that Mr. Clinton has superior verbal skills. A sign of how much weight campaigns give to such voter impressions is the effort made by candidates to revise their self-presentations. During the 1988 Presidential primary campaign, for example, Representative Richard Gephardt took a pencil to his ghostly eyebrows to give them more definition. Mr. Bush reportedly tried to exchange his karate-like hand gestures for a more Presidential-looking set. Mr. Dole himself liked to say.''"

Bad Octobers in stock market history recalled (S) ,"IN the financial markets, as in election years, there have been more than a few October surprises, although they do not necessarily have political overtones. The worst recent surprise, of course, came in 1987 when the stock market crashed. That month ended with the Dow Jones industrial average down 23.2 percent, and investors in shock.1929 and All ThatThat plunge brought back memories of other bad Octobers, notably in 1978 and 1979, when the term'' October massacre'' became part of bond market lingo. Bond prices plunged, and stock prices suffered along with them. And, of course, the 1929 crash started in October. But four of the past five election-year Octobers have seen stock market declines, with 1988 being the only exception."

Whether they know it consciously or not, New Yorkers really want-- probably really need-- losing teams. Unlike minor league cities ( Milwaukee ) or uncities ( Anaheim ), New York does not require winning teams to give it a No. 1 identity, or, like Dallas, to replace old identities ( Who shot J.F.K.? Who shot J. R.?)Winning teams can actually be hazardous to a New Yorker's mental health. The teams left because Brooklyn and northern Manhattan could n't make the owners happy."

We're talking about casting tiny dry flies to extremely selective fish that connoisseurs call'' big heads''-- the jumbo rainbow trout of what might very well be the best reach of trout river in America, the upper Missouri, near Helena. Below Holter Lake, where Glyn Vincent, Isabelle Fritz-Cope and I fished the river, the Missouri is three times the width of the upper Delaware, filled with lush weed beds teeming with insect life, and loaded with trout. If the Missouri were merely a great river chockablock with easily caught trout, it would be a Platonic novelty."

The Israeli people have voted.''Well, last week reality voted. Mr. Arafat, belatedly, came to understand that Israel could never keep up the momentum of peace without Palestinians making a 100 percent effort to guarantee Israeli security, and Mr. Peres came to understand that Mr. Arafat could never guarantee security unless the peace process continued its momentum. Every new Israeli road, every new tunnel, every new door opening took on strategic importance for the Palestinians and became a strategic threat, because each was seen as another step by Mr. Netanyahu in building a reality that denied basic Palestinian aspirations. He can, in his own way, pick up where Mr. Peres left off, and try to nurture a real strategic partnership with the Palestinians on the basis of mutual respect and mutual security."
"Editorial urges Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to move quickly to higher ground, lest peace efforts be consumed by violent conflict ","Both the Israeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian leader need urgently to move to higher ground. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat must reaffirm some essential ground rules about Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza. In the last days Israelis and Palestinians saw their worst fears about self-rule come true. Many members of the Palestinian police force, armed by the Israelis to maintain security in Palestinian-controlled towns, turned their automatic weapons against Israeli soldiers in deadly fire fights. Mr. Arafat should make a firm commitment that Palestinian police officers will not again open fire on Israeli troops. Israel should suspend the construction project in Jerusalem that led to the Palestinian rioting."
"Editorial on coming of autumn's light after rainy, dark summer in the country ","Never were the fungicidal qualities of exterior paint more highly prized than this year. Even as daylight slackens, week by week, the turning, yellowing leaves will reflect more light at wavelengths with a warm, inviting cast. As the leaves cover the ground, the floor of the deciduous forest will begin to throw light upward toward the sky. It has lived in the green shade beside a rotting porch all summer long. One glimpses it only now and then-- a slender gray bird wearing a black skullcap, scratching among the lower branches along the edge of the woods. There is a faintly mechanical quality to its song, as though the notes were produced by small bells or the operation of intricate machinery."
Editorial reviews record of 104th Congress led by Newt Gingrich and his band of aggressive Republicans ,"They dominated the national debate and instituted significant reforms of Congressional procedures. Some of this Congress's handiwork has been shortsighted, and in one egregious instance-- the new welfare law-- the President was a willing accomplice. Especially impressive were their successful efforts to overhaul the farm subsidy program and ease regulations in the telecommunications business. Republicans and Democrats alike deserve blame for failing to address campaign financing reform and the continuing influence of powerful special interests. The greatest item of unfinished business in the 104th Congress is the same as it was in the 103d: health care. Mr. Clinton's overwrought reforms in his first two years were essentially defeated because Americans feared that they would diminish their own health choices and programs."

All these chores add up to real work. In 1992, people earned 9,552 time dollars.

Officials say they are impressed by how the system can generate work and work experience as it helps foster commerce and community cohesion. The law says work can include time looking for a job, some vocational training, and community service for public and nonprofit employers for which workers continue receiving welfare checks in lieu of regular pay. The system also opens a road to the world of real work."

"Florida State University football team defeats North Carolina, 13-0 (M) ","The rain kept falling today and the Florida State defense kept coming-- eight sacks' worth against the beleaguered North Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf. Statisticians were still searching for the last time a team limited Florida State to two first downs in the first half. Florida State's first score-- a 33-yard field goal by Scott Bentley on the second period's first play-- came after the first assist from its special teams. Tar Heels' deepest penetration was to the Florida State 30 in the first quarter. It turned out to be me.''The Seminoles got a gift-wrapped opportunity midway through the period when Jackson blocked his second punt of the game. That set up Florida State at the Carolina 24, but three plays netted only 4 yards, and Bentley came in to kick a 37-yard field goal."

For Gooden, the glass slipper no longer fits. Torre conceded he had touted Gooden as a candidate to start in the third game for psychological reasons. Gooden finished the regular season with 170 2/3 innings, a total he had not reached since 1993, an 11- 7 record and a 5.01 earned run average. Torre guessed that Gooden'' hit the wall'' and said the Yankees will determine whether more rest and more tinkering might revive him for a post-season start."

Courtroom remark by former South African police colonel that apartheid Government was involved in 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Min Olof Palme noted (S) ,"After days of grisly testimony on the atrocities committed by South Africa's apartheid police force, a former police colonel stunned a Pretoria court room last week when he mentioned, almost in passing, that South Africa was involved in the 1986 assassination of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, who held strong anti-apartheid views. The Prime Minister was shot in the back of the head by a lone gunman as he was walking home from a movie with his wife. The police colonel, Eugene de Kock, who was convicted last month on 89 charges ranging from murder to fraud, was testifying at a hearing to help the judge decide on his sentence when he said that one of South Africa's most notorious spies, a man named Craig Williamson, killed Palme.

Finding that most common gene mutation in white people makes them resistant to AIDS virus noted (S) ,"The most common gene mutation in the white population is turning out to be a real wild card: It makes people resistant to the AIDS virus. An extensive study of the gene found that one out of 100 Caucasians has inherited two copies of the mutated gene, and that they can not be infected with the AIDS virus. An additional one out of five whites has inherited a single copy of the gene. David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said a mutation that knocks out the function of a normal gene, as this one does, would not persist at high levels in a population unless it also conferred some benefit. So, scientists are asking whether the gene provided resistance to some ancient European plague, perhaps even AIDS itself."

When Kabul was overrun last week by Islamic fundamentalist rebels known as the Taliban, they took only minutes to hang the man who had become the symbol of Soviet intervention, Najibullah, the former president and most hated figure in modern Afghan history. The Taliban movement, named for students educated in Muslim religious schools, was welcomed by soldiers and civilians alike on the road to Kabul. Afghans clearly want peace.

Stan Guthrie letter wonders that Sept 25 editorial would raise teacher salaries when too many teachers have not studied the subjects they teach ,"Then, in a classic non sequitur, you advocate increasing teacher salaries. Do you really think it is wise to reward mediocrity with fatter paychecks?As long as the education profession is dominated by unaccountable unions that demand tenure and block the real reforms you advocate, paying higher salaries is just throwing good money after bad. As you note the same day in an Education page article on Roman Catholic schools in New York City, teacher salaries are far from the key issue. In the schools you surveyed, which graduated at least 98 percent of students in four years, compared with 48.2 percent in the New York City public schools, teacher salaries were, on average, $ 19,000 to $ 20,000 less than those in the government-run schools."
Carmine J Giordano letter says teacher training should include time working in industries whose future employees will be taught in schools ,"To the Editor: Raising professional standards for teachers will not alone produce a teacher corps adequate to the demands of high-technology and the information age ( editorial, Sept. 25 ). It will also take community-based learning experiences to train the 21st-century teacher. Prospective teachers should be required to spend paid training and working internships in the industries whose eventual employees they will be teaching. Industry employees, in turn, should be allowed to participate in creating courses for and giving instruction to 21st-century teachers. This would assure the currency of the classroom teacher's data base and the possibility that academics would be made more relevant."
Matthew Menken letter says quality education cannot take place unless there is quality curriculum and teachers are given authority to fail students who do not meet standards ,"To the Editor: You rightly support better pay for better teachers ( editorial, Sept. 25 ), although that alone is unlikely to overcome the'' rising tide of mediocrity'' in the nation's schools. My late parents, with 50 years of teaching experience between them, encountered massive indifference to quality standards, because most people do not understand the foundation of education quality. A majority of people think that a traditional curriculum lacks relevance for modern society. Quality education can not occur unless teachers are given the authority to fail students who do not meet standards without facing meaningless administrative guidelines and an appeals process. For committed teachers, better pay is important, but less important than greater respect and autonomy. Teaching Does n't Warrant Better Pay"

Rejecting Bob Dole's plan, you offer no solution to the excessive taxes borne by American families, but conclude with the insipid contention that President Clinton's plan'' would do no harm.''Moreover, I do n't accept your claim that'' the economy is now operating at full bore.''

How are we going to pay for President Clinton's tax increases on income and gas? In 1990, according to Internal Revenue Service statistics, the top 1 percent of wage earners paid about 25 percent of all Federal income taxes.

The American Medical Association, after reviewing more than 200 health plan contracts, found numerous examples of clauses like the ones excerpted your Week in Review article. We have worked with plans to provide contractual language to protect their business needs without compromising clinical disclosures to patients. Unfortunately, the position of some participants in the health plan industry has been to continue to fight against full patient access to medical information. This fall, 13 more states will introduce such legislation."

It is no secret that our health care cost is much higher than any of these countries. Why are we then spending a lot more for a shorter life span?Perhaps the most important reason for our poor results has been a lack of emphasis on primary care. Our obsession with high-technology medicine has not helped us to be a leader in life expectancy and infant mortality rates. It is time that we set a goal of producing a lot more physicians interested in practicing primary care."

Promise Keepers illumines the spiritual vacuum in much of the'' liberal'' agenda of mainline churches.

Like the Jets then, the Yankees do n't need a new stadium.

Dummy played low, and East won with the queen and led the spade ten. South won with the king, a good play, and cashed another top heart. Next she cashed the club ace and led the last diamond, forcing West to concede a trick to the spade jack at the finish.

Anthony Tommasini reviews New York City Opera production of La Boheme (M) ,"Even at the New York City Opera, where giving opportunities to emerging American singers is a house policy, it is not too often that three cast members make simultaneous debuts. But that is what Friday night offered with Graziella Sciutti's rewardingly intimate production of Puccini's'' Boheme.''William Joyner, a North Carolina-born tenor making his debut as Rodolfo, seemed vocally jittery in Act I, with breathy low notes and a tight top range. The soprano Laurinda Nikkel, in her debut as Musetta, mostly relied on the standardized portrayal of the character as a coquettish Latin Quarter diva. Lester Lynch, a robust baritone, made a hearty Marcello. No one will yet mistake the New York City Opera Orchestra for a great ensemble."
"Kinshasa Journal: Booming City, Flush With Rats and Dying Children**Peasants from all over Zaire make their way to Kinshasa in search of better life; few find one; urban development experts say Kinshasa is city with exploding population, many slums and virtually no planning or management; map; photo (M) ","From their two-room shack that clings to the hillside next to a gully carrying raw sewage through one of this city's many slums, Georgine Meme and her nine children set out each morning in search of life's basics. Every day Mrs. Meme's story is repeated by the thousands, as wave after wave of peasants from all over Zaire make their way to Kinshasa in search of a better life. Last year, a health crisis erupted when, depending upon whose version one believes, city officials either made off with funds budgeted for the chlorine used to purify the municipal water supply, or the money for that purpose simply ran out. And as groups like this multiply, people say the existence of well-functioning councils can mean the difference between life and death."

Jennifer Dunning reviews program matching Alpha-Omega Theatrical Dance Company and Rod Rodgers Dance Company Marymount Manhattan Theater (M) ,"The matching of the Alpha-Omega Theatrical Dance Company and the Rod Rodgers Dance Company in a program on Saturday afternoon at Marymount Manhattan Theater was both fortunate and unlucky.

The other outstanding Rodgers piece was'' El Encounter,'' danced by Kevin Gaudin and Ms. Sako to music by Chick Corea. Alpha-Omega presented a similarly rooted duet called'' Goodbye,'' choreographed by the company director, Enrique Cruz DeJesus, to music by Howard Hewett. Goodbye'' was an emotionally complex portrait of hesitant, worldly-wise lovers, poignantly played by Mr. DeJesus and Donna Clark. Andy Torres's witty'' Senor Blues,'' a group jazz piece performed to music by Horace Silver, epitomizes the company style. DANCE REVIEW"

For its New York shows, Pearl Jam booked two nights at Downing Stadium, on Randalls Island, where it played its first concert on Saturday night. To leave the stadium's parking area, the traffic jam was half an hour longer than Pearl Jam's 110-minute set. Downing Stadium's traffic mess is no secret to promoters. With its Pyrrhic victory over Ticketmaster, Pearl Jam dodged the real question: Why was it playing a general-admission stadium concert at all? But stadium shows usually generate more profits than music. At Downing Stadium, concertgoers had two choices. Pearl Jam sacrificed most of the music's intelligence to the stadium setting."

Under the watchtowers and army guard posts, men and women collected groceries from the settlement office, determined to maintain normal routines in abnormal times. Both Labor leaders criticized isolated settlements as burdens on the army that contributed nothing to Israel's security, although in the self-rule accords with the Palestinians, they both insisted that the settlements remain in place under Israeli protection.

Jennifer Dunning reviews performances in 70th-birthday homage to Indian dancer Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra at Symphony Space; photo (M) ,"Dance and drama are inextricably bound in Indian classical dance, as are the spirit and the flesh. That was underscored, both consciously and unintentionally, in a 70th-birthday homage to Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra, a master teacher of the Odissi dance form, on Friday night at Symphony Space. Pure rather than inherently narrative movement is stressed, however, in Odissi, one of the oldest forms of Indian dance. In the guru's teaching and his choreography, even more emphasis is put on the articulated upper body than is the norm in Indian dance. The two crude narrative pieces looked like a Mel Brooks parody of Indian dance. DANCE REVIEW"

It obstructed the new possibilities for relations with other states of the Middle East. It was not a sentimental decision, as Rabin was not a sentimental man. The talks hosted by President Clinton this week may well decide whether Israel stays on that new path.

Just as the challenge to Israeli sovereignty over its undivided capital was the essence of this summer's election, last week's assault-rifle intifada was the Arab escalation to violence in the battle for Jerusalem. Palestinians were given to believe by their leaders that under Shimon Peres, the peace process would inexorably lead to an independent state on the West Bank, with Israeli settlers as guests of the Arabs until ejected, and with Jerusalem to be'' shared'' as the Palestinian capital. But the Jews of Israel overwhelmingly voted no to such an insecure peace. Locally, his armed forces, having killed 14 Israeli soldiers, are now heroes to the rioters they had first supported. Only Israel's hard-liners can secure a peace secure enough to last."

Some contend it already has and that under the welfare law, that phenomenon will grow. The point is, with the new law mandating ever more workers from the welfare ranks, workers with little skill and experience will be scrambling for the same jobs. Because from the beginning there was an unspoken understanding that welfare workers could become unofficial replacement workers, despite curbs on workfare in the state social services law. NOW the new Federal welfare act expressly states that governments'' may fill a vacant employment position'' with a welfare worker as long as there were no layoffs."

Because of the 11th Amendment to the Constitution, which largely indemnifies states from being sued by individuals in Federal court, Mr. Roberts traditionally would have had no recourse against Florida or any other state that he believed had infringed his patent.

Judge Miller's behavior-- fueled by jealousy and a desire for revenge-- was inexcusable.

The idea is that lawmakers who vote for a pay raise should stand for re-election before they get the money. The legislators use taxpayer money to underwrite self-promoting mailings and television spots. The legislators, for their part, can convince the state that a pay raise is a good bargain with a series of reforms. The state also needs serious campaign finance reform that imposes strict limits on the size of contributions and rewards lawmakers who collect a large number of small donations.

While Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Arafat have been unyielding in their public statements about the issues that ignited last week's violence, both men repeatedly reaffirmed their desire to salvage the peace effort. Israel used helicopter gunships in the towns it turned over to Palestinian control under the peace accords. It is not too late to use this crisis as a springboard to peace."

These explanations though, never fully accounted for the planetary retrogrades. Its retrograde motion even helped me write this column.

"Debate attended by most of Connecticut's Congressional candidates held, Hartford, with debaters offering partisan views on many of issues (M) ","In a debate attended by most of Connecticut's Congressional candidates, Republican Representative Nancy L. Johnson tried to cast the current Congress as a moderate body that passed historic legislation with bipartisan support.''It was not extreme,'' said Ms. Johnson, a seven-term incumbent from New Britain. The 90-minute debate featured partisan views on Congressional gridlock, balancing the budget, tax cuts, welfare reform and health care. She also hailed legislation that allows workers to maintain health insurance if they change or lose their jobs. And Charlotte Koskoff, Ms. Johnson's Democratic challenger, attacked the Republican proposal, vetoed by President Clinton, to cut future spending for Medicare by $ 270 billion."
Jack Anderson reviews performance of Dance Kumikokimoto at St Mark's Church; photo (S) ,"Later, in a strange purification ritual, a man bathed in a suitcase filled with water while other dancers stacked cartons in front of him, gradually blocking him from view. A program note said'' Masao'' concerned an elderly Korean man who moved to Japan before World War II; the program also included a short history of the troubled relations between Korea and Japan. Such political matters obviously mean much to the choreographer, Koosil-ja Hwang, a New York-based dancer born in Japan of Korean parents who has previously performed under the name of Kumiko Kimoto. And the choreographer made her drably clad dancers look so weary as they kept shifting cartons about that'' Masao'' often seemed to concern not political oppression, but the spiritually numbing effects of certain types of repetitive and monotonous work movements."

Jack Anderson reviews performance of Tai Dang and Company at Columbus Park (S) ,"Stormy Weather, Happy Ending'Have Red Ever Green' Columbus Park ChinatownNature and art were ominously, yet appropriately, allied on Saturday night when Tai Dang and Company danced'' Have Red Those theatrical noises were superfluous, for it was raining in real life. It continued to rain-- sometimes lightly, sometimes heavily-- throughout the hourlong production, presented by Dancing in the Streets and the Asian American Arts Alliance. A program note stated that it concerned the memories of an old man in the year 2100. In one, what at first appeared to be a line of fumbling blind people turned into sinister inquisitors. Yet there were moments of reassurance, and the production ended on a cautiously hopeful note when the text proclaimed life a journey in which the traffic lights are green."
Jennifer Dunning reviews performance of Croatian troupe Montazstroj at Performance Space 122 (S) ,"Surprising Vignettes From a Croatian TroupeMontazstroj Performance Space 122One might have expected Montazstroj, a Croatian performance art troupe from Zagreb, to deal with war in'' The three performers-- Srecko Borse, Bernarda Pesa and Damir Klemenic-- move quickly through a great many vignettes, all of them seeming to unfold in a chill, abandoned city filled with silvery light and shadows. A microphone draped with a wig of long, glossy blond hair is used for announcements that range from artistic statements to what sounds like a dictator's screaming exhortation, translated sweetly by Ms. Pesa into mostly ridiculous statements about life in her country. There is little careful irony of the sort that is too often a part of American performance art. JENNIFER DUNNINGIN PERFORMANCE: PERFORMANCE ART"
Jon Pareles reviews performance of music group Wild Colonials at The Fez (S) ,"In Tales of HeartbreakWild Colonials The FezFervor and bathos are never far apart in the songs of the Wild Colonials, who performed on Wednesday night at the Fez. The Los Angeles group is led by Angela McCluskey, who was born in Scotland, and it has the unabashed sincerity and folky melodies of Celtic rockers from Christy Moore to Big Country to the Cranberries. She and the band write concise melodies and deliver them with broad dynamic swoops. The songs build with Shark's guitar strumming and Paul Cantelon's tremolos and slides on violin, then grow hushed while Ms. McCluskey begins another emotional climb. The group returns to the Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, in the East Village, on Wednesday."

"Technology that breathes life into many computer creatures may soon be made easier; Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute has spent two years developing system that captures motion using camera that can measure warmth of human body; simplicity of system broadens its possible commercial application; for example, it could be used to free virtual reality from its current constraints, which require person to wear headgear and work a keyboard, mouse or data glove; photos (M) ","The technology that breathes life into many computer creatures may soon be cut loose. The motions can by captured by computer software and seen almost as quickly as they take place. As his or her motions are filmed the images are fed into a computer and digitized. Then the computer tracks the coordinates of the colored spots on each frame. The motion data is translated from spots on the human joints to the joints of a computer character. Stan Winston, four-time Academy Award winner for his movie creatures, saw A.T.R.'s project when it was demonstrated at Siggraph, a computer graphics conference in New Orleans last August, and has told associates he is interested in it. It could be used to teach people tasks that are not possible using standard computer techniques."

Mr. Falwell was awarded $ 200,000 by a trial court in Virginia, but the United States Supreme Court reversed the decision in 1988 ruling that the parody was protected by the First Amendment.''It was a wry humor to cast me as an anti-free speech lawyer since I wrote a brief supporting the free speech position in the case,'' Professor Neuborne said."
"Pittsburgh Steelers defeat Houston Oilers, 30-16 (M) ","The former Steelers coach Chuck Noll would not even shake hands with the former Oilers coach Jerry Glanville after games, because Noll believed Glanville coached dirty tactics.
