Richard Schlesinger letter on Sept 8 article on Eddie Murray ,"To the Sports Editor: Re:'' Murray Hits a Milestone; Is the Hall of Fame Next?'' ( The Times, Sept. 8), Eddie Murray not in the Hall? If you think the only reason Murray got as far as he did was longevity, take another look at his 1995 season, when, at 39, he batted.323 and contributed in a big way to another pennant winner. In fact, it's no coincidence that Murray was always involved with winners, from the Orioles to the Dodgers to the Indians. That's because Murray is a model of consistent production."

Living in proximity to the United States Open had always been an exciting opportunity to watch the world's best players in our own backyard. Now, however, not only are we forced to endure the rattling of our windows and doors by low-flying LaGuardia planes, we ca n't even get tickets to the Open, having been closed out by corporate purchases of blocks of even more expensive seats.

That is most improbable.

Dr Thomas Szasz letter comments on Sept 11 article on involvement of billionaire currency trader George Soros in campaign to legalize use of marijuna for medicinal purposes (S) ,"To the Editor: Much as I would like to sympathize with the financier George Soros's efforts to combat the harm wrought by the drug war ( news article, Sept. 11 ), it is an error to align him too closely with the drug war dissidents. Making a drug available by prescription is neither legalization nor decriminalization: it is med icalization. Morphine is a legal drug, if you can get a physician to prescribe it for you. Of course, you ca n't because physicians rightly fear being persecuted by the Drug Enforcement Administration for'' overprescribing.''Making marijuana a prescription drug merely shifts the user's fear of possessing it to the physician's fear of prescribing it. It would add one more plant product to the category of'' dangerous drugs,'' controlled by the Government."

Elizabeth Hess letter disputes Sept 11 Personal Health column on adopting puppies from shelters (S) ,"To the Editor: While the Sept. 11 Personal Health column suggests adopting puppies from shelters, it discourages taking home'' troublesome'' adult pets. Contrary to what it says, however, most adult dogs are relinquished not because they are'' troublesome'' but because their owners are moving and the new landlords wo n't allow pets. Adult dogs are likely to be housebroken, leash-trained and socialized. Most shelters weed out the animals with serious behavior problems. There is no reason to encourage prejudice against older animals when they are often easier to handle than puppies.

Rosenberg's contention that Madison Avenue does not need improvement does not reflect the support expressed by the majority of 700 property owners and 300 merchants in the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District's two-year formation process. Since the district's establishment, Madison Avenue is the only 26-block stretch in the city that is graffiti-free.

Miller ( letter, Sept. 11 ) is mistaken when he writes that the states have no legal problem with a male-to-female transsexual marrying a man.

She was also making a new legal claim for immigration, increasing her chance of being returned. On Sept. 17 a Senate-House conference committee will consider additional amendments to the immigration bill.

Murray Grode letter comments on Sept 8 article on Federal financing of Presidential election campaigns (S) ,"Outside of what amounts to confiscation of hard-earned wages of beleaguered taxpayers through subsidization of the political parties to the estimated tune of $ 172 million, I do n't see how Congress and our political leaders can merit or retain the confidence of the American public. How could they have the gall to introduce legislation that would curtail such vital programs as environmental protection, crime prevention, food inspection, gun control, cancer research, clean water-- just to name a few-- and still face the public in seeking election or staying in office?On top of all this are the millions of dollars contributed by special interests to gain legislative privileges."

South concluded that West must have a void club, and put up dummy's diamond king, an unusual play that allowed for the slight chance that West had underled the ace.

Microsoft, the computer software giant, is trying to dislodge a smaller company, Netscape, from its dominant position in the market for browsers, the specialized software tool needed to surf the World Wide Web. Last month, Microsoft launched a new and improved version of its browser, called Internet Explorer 3.0. Using these features once required retrieving and installing specialized software from the Internet. More recently, interest has shifted heavily to the Internet and its star attraction, the World Wide Web. Netscape, meanwhile, operates mainly in the Internet browser field and fears that Microsoft will use its powerful presence in other software areas to unfair advantage."

Although the central agency decides whether intervention is necessary, the community group is likely to know more about a child's neighborhood environment and may even be familiar with the family itself. Following the initial investigation, responsibilities are divided up, with the community groups providing services to low-risk families and the central agency focusing on more serious cases."

( front page, Sept. 13 ) is that it moves the public's awareness ever southward toward the site where Europe first planted its institutions, culture and religion on our soil. Decades before Jamestown, the first city government, first town plan, first school, hospital, court, financial institution, parish church and mission to the natives were established there. In 1993, the original Spanish fort at St. Augustine, dating from 1565, was excavated by University of Florida archeologists. If we can get our historical consciousness re-sited as far south as Florida, we will start to consider the towns and institutions of the people who were already here."

"Some scientists suggest that carbonadoes, large black diamonds that follow none of normal rules of diamond mineralogy, originated in heat from natural radiation, asteroid impacts and exploding stars; American Geophysical Union recently held meeting on impact diamonds and carbonadoes, sharpening debate; carbonadoes, used industrially, are found mainly in Brazil and Central African Republic and are mined from stream beds; map; photo (M) ","THE source of the world's largest diamonds-- black stones known as carbonadoes-- has long been a geological puzzle. The world's largest diamond is a carbonado, said Dr. Haggerty, an expert on the black diamonds. The next-largest diamonds ever found in Brazil are also carbonadoes, weighing 2,000 carats, 932 carats and 828 carats. This picture of carbonado formation was discredited in the 1960's and 1970's as scientists studied the mineral inclusions and carbon isotopes of the black diamonds. It showed, he said, that the black diamonds might have been produced in a fiery impact. He also noted that extra-solar diamonds found in meteorites appeared to have isotope signatures quite like those of carbonadoes. He called the diamonds'' boulders of star dust.''"

Researchers at the mental health institute, meanwhile, have been studying five sets of identical twins with Tourette's whose tics vary in severity. The other twin has extremely mild tics. Thus tics are fragments of movements or thoughts, split off from more integrated behavior. Tics may be much more common than most most people realize, said Dr. Ann Young, a neurologist at Harvard University who is chairwoman of the Tourette Syndrome Association Scientific Advisory Board.''

Some scientists are warning that ocean fish and invertebrate species are at perilously low levels and face possible extinction; scientific debate could intensify when World Conservation Union adds over 100 oceanic fish species to its 'red list' of endangered species in October; marine biologists cite overexploitation of long-lived species that cannot reproduce fast enough and disruption of narrow habitats to which many species are confined; drawing (M) ,"But depletion is not endangerment, and it has long been assumed that the sea is so vast and fecund that marine fish and invertebrates are generally in no danger of extinction at the hands of humans.

That combination of factors is landing 19 species of groupers and closely related fishes on the red list.

Children already in junior high school can stay until they finish, but not go on to high school. Only grizzled kids now in high school can stay until they finish.

This frees the characters from ornate 18th-century wigs and costumes and allows the tale of passing affairs and marital hypocrisy among the Austrian nobility to seem newly cynical and wise. For all its strengths, this'' Rosenkavalier'' did not provide the soaring voices the opulently lyrical score demands. Ms. Holleque, a vivid actress, has an attractive, warm but not exceptional voice.

The highest energy rays are produced by particles traveling at energies greater than 1020 electron-volts. The enormous size of the detector arrays will make it possible to track cosmic ray particles accurately enough to pinpoint the direction from which they came."

"Demand for doctors making house calls is seen growing around country; in New York City, St Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Greenwich Village has seen demand for house calls grow in recent years, as number of elderly people increases, and as their hospital stays decrease as result of insurance restrictions; around country, doctors who did not make house calls now find that they must; experts say it is not only the elderly that are driving doctors to rethink where they practice medicine; it is growing number of AIDS patients as well as children and teen-agers disabled by violence, many of whom want desperately to remain at home (M) ","SEVERAL weeks ago, a Manhattan resident called a doctor And around the country, doctors who did not make house calls are now finding that they must. The return of the house call was the subject of an American Medical Association symposium held in New York last week. Part of the reason why doctors do n't make more house calls is that they're reimbursed at a rate that's below cost,'' he said. The symposium discussed some innovations that are intended to help doctors make more house calls. Next, while the patient remained on the video screen, Ms. Hanson called a second telephone line in her home to demonstrate other components of the system, a digital stethoscope and a digital blood pressure monitor."
"Scientists conclude that dangerous abnormalities in heart rhythm are more likely to occur on Mondays and Fridays than on other days of week; study of patients being treated for heart disease does not explain pattern, but because abnormal heartbeats peak at beginning and end of workweek, researchers suggest that stress and fatigue might play role (M) ","DANGEROUS abnormalities in heart rhythm are more likely to occur on Mondays and Fridays than on other days of the week, scientists have concluded from a study of patients being treated for heart disease. The findings mirrored those already reported for heart attacks and heart-related deaths, which are also more common on Mondays, and in the morning. The implantable devices monitor heart rhythm and, if it goes awry, fire electric shocks to return it to normal. At that rate, the heart can not pump effectively, and both the brain and the heart itself become starved for oxygen. The researchers also found that a type of heart medication called a beta blocker appeared to protect patients from the Monday surge in arrhythmias."
Elahe S Hicks letter lauds Thomas L Friedman's Sept 11 Op-Ed column calling for reappraisal of US policy toward Iran (S) ,"While the scale of human rights violations may have lessened in recent years, the Iranian Constitution and other applied laws do not provide fundamental human rights safeguards. Leaders of minority religious communities remain excluded from political life and face imprisonment or execution. Opposition or independent journalists also face prosecution, imprisonment and corporal punishment for exercising their right to free expression. While there is a need for new thinking on United States policy on Iran, this new thinking should not disregard respect for human rights and the rule of law that would transform the behavior of the Iranian authorities, holding them accountable for their action both to their own people as well as to the international community. 1996The writer is a consultant with Human Rights Watch-Middle East."
"Members of Brazilian samba school lead parade through Lyons, France, as part of Lyons Dance Biennial; photo (M) ","Guy Darmet, the biennial's artistic director, who dreamed up the idea of taking his dance festival to the people, was predictably delighted. Certainly, Mr. Darmet can claim credit for picking Brazilian dance as the theme of this year's biennial. Brazilian dance is very integrated into religious ceremonies, such as the candomble of Bahia. In contrast, Brazil's best known modern dance company, Grupo Corpo, is very much home-grown. What perhaps best characterizes Brazilian dance today is its great sense of freedom. In recognition of the strong ties between popular music and dance, Mr. Darmet has invited two prominent Brazilian singers, Beth Carvalho and Caetano Veloso, to form part of the biennial ( although Mr. Veloso will, in fact."

"Smashing Pumpkins perform at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, NJ; photo of Billy Corgan, band's lead singer and main songwriter; Jon Pareles review (M) ","The concert was postponed after the band's backup keyboardist, Jonathan Melvoin, died of a heroin overdose and its drummer, Jimmy Chamberlin, was fired for drug problems. With Matt Walker of Filter sitting in on drums, the Smashing Pumpkins are a changed band: full-tilt, unambivalent arena-rockers, walloping one riff after another. The band, with D'Arcy on bass and Dennis Flemion on keyboards, performed amid arty trappings: video screens showing kaleidoscopic images and antique films ( including Georges Melies's 1902'' Voyage to the Moon,'' an early special-effects showcase ) to suggest a combination of psychedelia and science fiction. Opening the concert was Grant Lee Buffalo, a trio led by Grant Lee Phillips. The two bands are to perform tonight at Madison Square Garden."

Without costumes and scenery, more than 75 members of productions past were reunited onstage for a concert performance of the theater piece. But at the Carnegie Hall reunion, there were also two singers in the roles of his daughters, Antigone ( Isabell Monk and Bernadine Mitchell ) and Ismene ( Jevetta Steele and Shari A. Seals).Because of this layering of parts and the informality of the show, Suspense came not from dramatic tension but from performance tension: the singers' fear that with one day of rehearsals to remind them of their parts, mistakes would happen."
Second of two Jane E Brody columns on living safely with dogs; describes how to choose a dog for your family's safety and sanity; chart compares characteristics of golden retriever and Scottish terrier; drawings (M) ,"MANY dog lovers act on impulse when they acquire canine companions. Does it attack other dogs? Furthermore, dog lovers are often very loyal to a breed, and may choose it despite certain distressing characteristics. Then there is the matter of the sex of the dog. Many dog owners insist that mutts make nicer, less temperamental and physically healthier pets. If you know the parents of the mutt and consider the characteristics of each, you can get a fair idea of the animal's likely behavior as an adult dog. The dog's mother does the former and the mother's human family and the puppy's adoptive family do the latter. It is important for the dog to learn who is boss. You do n't send the dog off to school without you."
Cuban singer Issac Delgado performs at SOB's; Peter Watrous review (M) ,"The singer Issac Delgado spent his second set at S.O.B.'s on Monday night singing three songs. The show was as close to a modern Cuban style as New York has heard, rhythmic, fluid and hard dance music at its best. The club was packed with fans starved to hear the new sounds. When he sang, he sounded as if he'd never strained at anything in his life. Underneath virtually everything he sang was more than just a passing familiarity with older Cuban singers: Mr. Delgado was brought up hearing them sing in his house. Deeper was the sound of Afro-Cuban religious music, and during the chants Mr. Delgado relied on the compact melodies, the bold simple twists that mark the music, for his improvisations. MUSIC REVIEW"

The amnesty left open crucial questions about Mr. Ieng Sary's future in Cambodian society and politics and even his vulnerability to future prosecution. The amnesty made specific mention only of Mr. Ieng Sary's death sentence in absentia in 1979-- along with Mr. Pol Pot-- by a Vietnamese-backed Cambodian court and of a 1994 law that outlawed the Khmer Rouge movement. Despite the evidence against Mr. Ieng Sary and other leaders, independent analysts say there are serious obstacles to any eventual trial of Khmer Rouge leaders."

You might call'' Dadetown,'' which opens today at the Film Forum, a virtual documentary. As unforeseen traumas unravel the town's snug social fabric, the film makers remain in Dadetown to record the damage.

All it took was a last-minute plea by Mr. Reed on Wednesday, and Mr. Dole flip-flopped, embracing Mr. Robertson on stage at the Washington Hilton on Saturday. How close is Mr. Dole to the religious right? Saturday's happy embrace of Mr. Robertson is, in other words, completely consistent with Mr. Dole's record; it's the five weeks in which he and the Christian Coalition were estranged that were aberrational. Robertson also said it would take a'' miracle from Almighty God'' to elect Mr. Dole. Maybe so, but should that miracle happen, it will be Mr. Robertson, not God, who will be passing judgment on nominees to the Supreme Court."

But the United States currently imports only about 10 percent of its oil from the Persian Gulf-- some $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion worth, depending on world prices."

The Administration said more than one million workers each year moved to a new employer where rollovers were not accepted and that 50 percent of 401(k ) plans did not accept rollovers from new employees. Another obstacle is employer worry that rollovers may jeopardize their plan's compliance with rules that bar skewing benefits in favor of the highest-paid employees. The Treasury proposes a regulation declaring that rollovers from new employees, including those not yet eligible to participate in the new employer's plan, will not cause plans to run afoul of the nondiscrimination rules. She then switched to a new employer without any pension plans. The Treasury's new guidance does not bar employers from distinguishing between current and former employees, Mr. Iwry said."

"Number of fish raised on farms has doubled in last decade; Federal and industry experts say that salmon is farm-raised in nearly every country with access to cold, deep water, and half shrimp eaten in country comes from farms; treasured bay scallops, found wild in a limited area between Long Island and Cape Cod, are exported by the ton from farms in China; photo (M) ","Farmed fish still represent a small portion of the amount of fish sold domestically. Take salmon, the most popular farmed fish. It appears, then, that there is sometimes a tradeoff of a pound of wild fish for each pound of farmed fish. Thus a-1-a-pound herring caught in the wild can be manufactured as food into a-5-a-pound farm-raised salmon, providing consumers with an expensive, mild-flavored fish. But menhaden are eaten by edible wild fish. In RestaurantsIF you order salmon in a Manhattan restaurant, you will almost certainly get a farmed fish. It's as if a new species of fish had been discovered. Many wild fish remain in reasonably good condition for a week, or even two, after being caught."

Cynthia Fuchs Epstein letter comments on Carol Tarvis's Sept 17 Op-Ed article on talk of gender gap during current Presidential election campaign (S) ,"Scientists who in their private lives would n't lump together chardonnay and riesling as'' white wine'' feel no compunction in generalizing'' sex differences'' from tiny statistical variations ( usually no more than 3 to 5 percent ) on personality and aptitude tests. Research on such attributes as self-esteem, assertiveness and cognitive abilities shows more similarities than differences between the sexes, and wide variation within each sex. A focus on gender differences without considering factors like power, education and situation has consequences that are far from benign. Educational policies oriented toward resegregation in schools, antagonism toward women who move outside of traditional roles and glorification of political leaders' war records rather than conciliation efforts are only a few problems that stem from these polarizing gender perspectives."

Marguerite Rosenthal letter responds to Sept 15 article about race by profit-making companies to run state welfare programs ,"Beginning in the 1300's and culminating in the landmark Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601, the task of taxing and distributing alms for the poor became a public duty.

No doubt some in the past have become rich from public programs designed to help the poor, but the notion of providing a financial incentive to private corporations to'' manage'' the lives of welfare recipients is an extreme departure from established procedures."

Advocates of legalized abortion have always justified their position by claiming that the fetus is not a life. The pro- choice effort to call the fetus a disposable thing has never been quite convincing, even to women who have had abortions. Every third-trimester abortion is a tragedy. But it makes far more sense to think of abortion as a difficult issue, different at different months of pregnancy and at different times in a mother's life. As those who support abortion rights confront the pro-life movement, we need to face the fact that we have oversimplified the issue. But sometimes life is the wrong choice, a cruel choice, a tragic choice."

The salt appears. They have persisted despite the modest price of salt and the vast output of industries. So many young people have come to the medieval town of Guerande and its outlying salt pans that the local salt cooperative has opened a training center. But industrial salt had taken over the market and salt workers could not earn a decent salary. Thus the brand name'' Salt of Guerande'' was born. We say this is not salt but a condiment.''The marketing strategies of Mr. Perraud have already shown results. As salt fleets came and left, Guerande got rich on tolls and built its enormous city walls. At the Salt Museum in Batz, a historical exhibit shows that the tools and techniques have remained virtually unchanged."

Excerpts from President Clinton's speech at Grand Canyon (S) ,"PRESIDENT CLINTONSpeaking yesterday at Grand Canyon:''The first time I ever came to the Grand Canyon was also in 1971 in the summer. And one of the happiest memories of my entire life was when, for some flukey reason, even in the summertime, I found a place on a rock overlooking the Grand Canyon where I was all alone. And for two hours I sat and I lay down on that rock And I watched the colors change layer after layer after layer for two hours. And even today, 25 years later, in hectic, crazy times, in lonely, painful times, my mind drifts back to those two hours that I was alone on that rock watching the sunset over this canyon. I want more of those sights to be with all Americans for all time to come.''POLITICS"
Neil MacFarquhar analysis contends that Iraqi Pres Saddam Hussein's almost annual confrontations with West are enhancing his domestic image rather than eroding his rule (M) ,"But the United States expanded its military sway over the skies of Iraq, limiting his ability to bother his neighbors.

Internet sites reporting attacks include at least two chess server computers, which enable users to play chess electronically against remote opponents. Security officials are concerned because this type of attack exploits the basic design of the Internet itself. One partial solution is to configure each Internet service provider's routing computers so that they will not permit users to transmit messages that contain bogus addresses. Another vexing problem is tracing the location of a malicious computer user who is transmitting false addresses over the Internet."

These higher interest rates will reduce consumer spending, as borrowing costs increase. To the inflation hawks, unemployment is already too low. That'' natural'' rate, until recently taken to be around 6 percent, is called the Nairu, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. Others say that while high unemployment may reduce inflation, low unemployment may not increase it.

At the same time, the bill contains no serious steps to prevent illegal immigrants from taking American jobs. On an individual level, legal immigrants convicted of minor crimes would be deported with no judicial review. Illegal immigrants entering the country, who may not speak English or be familiar with American law, would be summarily deported if they do not immediately request asylum or express fear of persecution. The bill would also go further than the recently adopted welfare law in attacking legal immigrants."

Time Warner owns all or part of the HBO movie channel, Warner Brothers studio and Cinemax, while Turner owns CNN, TNT, Turner Classic Movies and other popular cable programs. The danger is that cable operators will be forced to buy from the merged company, putting Time Warner in position to boost prices for its programs. The commission also insisted that Time Warner sell its programs to rival cable operators at fair market rates."

"Futures prices of heating oil are high and inventories are low as refineries concentrate much of their production on diesel fuel because of continuing strong demand; some analysts believe refiners are at point where they will be unable to replenish heating-oil inventories in time for cold weather, making spike in heating-oil prices almost inevitable for consumers in Northeast; Ed Rothschild of Citizens Action, advocacy group, accuses refiners of keeping low inventories to reduce their costs, thus passing risk onto consuming public (M) ","Consumers in the Northeast could see heating-oil prices soar further-- especially if there is an unusually cold winter-- because inventories are extremely low.

He said that the retail price of heating oil could jump 10 cents to 20 cents a gallon in the next several weeks and move even higher. Some analysts also said that inventories were also lean in Europe and that soaring prices for gasoil, the equivalent for heating oil there, could also hurt imports.

Peter Passell (Economic Scene) column explores why Japan has been unable to shrug off its current economic problems (M) ,"Now it appears that the Government's sputtering effort to rekindle growth is once more failing: after a big first quarter, the economy actually shrank at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the second quarter. In earlier recessions, a weakening exchange rate made Japanese goods irresistible in world markets. The Bank of Japan has cut interest rates as far as they can be cut: bank depositors now earn just a quarter of 1 percent on their money. Putting it another way, deflation has left Japan with a real interest rate considerably higher than the nominal rate. ' There's nothing wrong here that an exchange rate of 130 yen to the dollar could n't fix,'' Higher interest rates in America-- rates not matched by the Bank of Japan-- should further weaken the yen."

"China's Communist Party leadership, after months of whipping up nationalist sentiment against Japan and other countries, suddenly seems to have realized that nationalism can spin out of control; Government has mobilized thousands of policemen in major cities to prevent demonstrations on anniversary of Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931 (M) ","Over the last several days, the Ministries of Public Security and State Security mobilized thousands of uniformed and plainclothes policemen in major cities to prevent demonstrations on the anniversary of Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931.

Historically, we get a major red tide bloom every 30 years or so,'' he added.'' Stockwell said red tides bear a neurotoxin, ichthyotoxin, that paralyzes a fish's ability to breathe."

News analysis discusses Republican Party's attempts to attract black vote; contends that recent history suggests that attempts will fail (M) ,"In a number of ways, the Republican Party has sought to make this the year it would break the Democratic hammerlock on the votes of black Americans.
