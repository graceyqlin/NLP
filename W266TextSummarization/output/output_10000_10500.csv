"University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey receives $627,000 Federal grant to set up medical kiosks in public housing complexes in Newark and Camden in order to make medical care more accessible (S) ","Doctors may not make house calls much anymore, but at two public housing complexes in Newark and Camden, they will soon be making two-way video conference calls. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey received a $ 627,000 Federal grant earlier this month to set up medical kiosks inside housing complexes that will resemble ATM's more than doctor's offices. Residents will be able to consult a doctor 24 hours a day, said Dr. Paul R. Mehne, who sought the grant. Dr. Mehne said the kiosks, scheduled to open by next summer, will make health care more accessible for the many residents of public housing who do not have cars, and at the same time cut down on unnecessary emergency room visits.

"An nual Hindu festival in Edison, NJ, that traditionally runs late into night will be allowed to go until 4 AM because Federal judge struck down midnight curfew (New Jersey Daily Briefing) (S) ","An annual Hindu festival that traditionally runs late into the night will be allowed to go until 4 A.M. because a Federal judge struck down a midnight curfew for large outdoor events that the township passed in June. Judge John C. Lifland of United States District Court ruled Friday that Edison's curfew was unconstitutional because it was aimed specifically at the Navratri festival, which honors the god Shakti with singing and dancing and attracts up to 100,000 people each fall to a privately owned lot near an industrial park. The festival, which runs for five consecutive weekends and begins on Oct. 11 this year, has drawn noise complaints in past years, and local officials have fought several legal battles with festival organizers."

It was the book deal with Mr. Morris that ignited the most sotto voce grumbling from Mr. Evans's rivals in the industry. The New Yorker's editor, Tina Brown, who is married to Mr. Evans, lunched with Mr. Evans and Mr. Morris and his wife on the day that the publisher reconfirmed the book deal. In 1996, the magazine purchased a total of 20 book excerpts, five of them from Random House.

The two Republicans praised and the two Democrats attacked the plan by Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential candidate, for a 15-percent tax cut. Gingrich argued that money for education was not as much of a problem as how it was spent.'' We spend far too much money on bureaucracy and not enough on teachers,'' he said.

Jerome I Levinson letter responds to Thomas L Friedman Sept 25 Op-Ed column on US bailout of Mexico ,"The issue has never been whether Mexico could repay the $ 12.5 billion United States loan to which he refers. That program is weighted disproportionately in the interests of capital and against workers, both within Mexico and the United States. Specifically, a million Mexican workers have lost their jobs since the start of the program demanded by the United States Treasury as the price of the bailout. The net value of Mexican auto-parts exports to the United States in the same period increased to $ 11 billion from $ 3.4 billion, representing a significant diversion of potential United States investment and jobs at home. In 1995 and thereafter, the burden has been placed exclusively upon the Mexican and United States worker."
Carlos Heredia letter responds to Thomas L Friedman Sept 25 Op-Ed column on US bailout of Mexico ,"To the Editor: It's no wonder that after talking to those in Mexico whose political and personal fortunes have been temporarily salvaged by the United States bailout, Thomas L. Friedman would call that bailout a success ( column, Sept. 25 ). In the 12 years leading to the devaluation, the adjustment policies promoted by the United States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank generated a concentration of wealth and and expansion of poverty without real economic growth. The intensified application of these policies since the bailout has produced social powder kegs from Chiapas to the United States border."
"Rabbi Avi Winokur letter on latest violence in Israel, West Bank and Gaza Strip ","To the Editor: As each side blames the other for the current violence in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the sad fact is that we are seeing the victory of Hamas and Islamic Jihad and of Yigal Amir, the assassin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Baruch Goldstein, who massacred 29 Muslims in Hebron, and their sympathizers. They have succeeded in drawing moderate Israelis and moderate Palestinians back into the cycle of hatred and violence. Unless and until Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, can publicly blame his own extremists along with the Israelis, and unless and until Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can blame his own extremists along with the Palestinians for the escalation of violence, then the chances for the peace process to succeed are much poorer."

The Arab protests were not based on the claim that the Al Aksa Mosque was being'' undermined,'' but on the broader issue that with every dig of the archeologist, with every new discovery about Jerusalem's past, the Jewish claim to the city is fortified. As this claim is strengthened, the Arab claim to the city, based on more recent events, becomes diminished."

For years the asylum system had been a magnet for fraud, which provided few guarantees for those fleeing persecution in their home countries.

Growing body of evidence is pointing to period spent in womb as having a major influence on risk of acquiring heart disease and other diseases; more than two dozen studies of people in several countries in all social and economic classes published over last half-dozen years suugest that what and how much a mother eats during pregnancy can 'program' a child's organ systems before birth and set stage for metabolic or hormonal changes that may result in disease many decades later (M) ,"There are genetic influences on small birth size, but researchers in these studies were at pains to correct for any such effect in their studies. The risks measured in the studies represent averages of the effects of different birth weights. Heart disease is one of the clearest results of poor maternal nutrition. Even more disturbing is the fact that in animal studies nutritional improvement after birth can not erase intrauterine deprivation that raises the risk of adult disease. Another study of the nurses published in September linked low birth weight to an increased risk of having high blood pressure as an adult. Another measure is having a placenta that is either unusually small or large in relation to the size of the baby at birth."

Yeltsin is undergoing tests in a hospital here in preparation for the heart bypass operation he needs, and extraordinary efforts are being made to send medical personnel and equipment for the surgery. Yeltsin's medical care has set off political rivalries abroad, particularly between the United States and Germany, and at home among Russian doctors and hospitals. Russia has good heart surgeons like Dr. Renat S. Akchurin, who is expected to perform Mr. Yeltsin's operation. Because they do too few cases a year, most Russian heart surgeons would not meet the credentialing standards at hospitals in the United States. Borst said they were leaders in Germany in bypass surgery and the care of critically ill patients. But they are also experts in heart and lung transplants. Also, heart surgery involves teamwork."

Since the lotus lily family is only distantly related to the arum lilies, there may turn out to be other examples of temperature regulation in plants once biologists start looking. The sacred lotus begins heating as its flowers start to bloom. Rather than having to wait for the sun to warm them, the beetles, warmed by the flower, could take off to deposit pollen on the next lotus flower. The big difference, she said, is that heat-producing plants have many more mitochondria than other plants."

Every survey of job vacancies in the United States in the past three decades has shown that the economy does not provide enough jobs to employ everyone who wants to work. When welfare recipients are put to work performing services that otherwise would be performed by other workers, job opportunities in the regular labor market shrink still faster.

Chad Mitchell Trio performs at Symphony Space; Stephen Holden review (S) ,"Among the gentlemanly post-collegiate folk groups that proliferated from the late 1950's until the advent of folk-rock in the mid-60's, none had the hip cachet of the Chad Mitchell Trio, which performed a reunion concert on Saturday evening at Symphony Space. Not only did the group's taste in material have a sharper political edge than that of its peers, but with a membership that included two first-rate folk-pop crooners ( Mr. Mitchell and Joe Frazier ) and one rougher-edged personality voice ( Mike Kobluk ), it also refined an unusually flexible vocal blend. The concert was a reminder that the folk-pop style exemplified by the Mitchell trio fused modern barbershop with the folk music movement that had been gathering strength since the heyday of the Weavers."

"Adam Goodheart Op-E article on Muslim and Jewish conflict over Jerusalem, in light of latest clash over Israel's opening of narrow tunnel along western retaining wall of Temple Mount; stresses Jerusalem's rich, shared heritage; holds any resolution of Jerusalem's status that settles exclusive control on one group will not simply be unjust, but untrue to its past (M) ","To many Arabs, Israel's opening of the narrow tunnel along the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount was another example of Israelis' disrespect for Muslim holy places and intransigent rule over East Jerusalem.

Arabs continue to oppose nearly all archeological exploration of the Temple Mount area, denying Jews the right to probe their own history.

"Editorial questions why US taxpayers must continue to subsidize merchant marine fleet, noting fleet is no longer vitally important in military sense, and is outperformed commercially by more efficient foreign-flag vessels ","For decades, taxpayers have spent billions subsidizing the American merchant marine fleet. An increasingly skeptical Pentagon, which has its own fleet of supply ships, has yet to state officially that it needs any standby merchant marine vessels at all. Of 500 vessels that plied the seas with supplies during that war, only 17 flew the United States flag and only 6 of those belonged to the subsidized fleet.

"Editorial questions Pres Ernesto Zedillo's commitment to enforce laws of Mexico fully and impartially, citing PRI's move that prematurely terminated congressional investigation into possible crimes or misconduct by Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of former Pres Carlos Salinas de Gortari; argues that unless rule of law is applied equally to all Mexicans, neither democracy nor free and transparent markets can take root ","The latest example came last week when a PRI majority prematurely terminated a congressional investigation into possible crimes or misconduct by Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The Zedillo administration can undo some of the damage by insisting that its attorney general vigorously prosecute the charges against Raul Salinas in the courts. Raul Salinas is now in jail facing charges of murder and illegal enrichment. By appointing an opposition party member as his attorney general, Mr. Zedillo initially raised hopes that his administration would aggressively prosecute politically sensitive cases like that of Raul Salinas. That record creates little confidence it will take on the powerful ruling party interests involved in the Raul Salinas corruption case. That is the powerful lesson of the unraveling of Carlos Salinas's presidency."

"A M Rosenthal Op-Ed column on prospects for peace between Israel and Palestinians; holds Palestinians can choose between war against Israel or peace talks with Israel, but they can no longer have both; contends that Washington conference called by Pres Clinton will be simply a step toward one more Mideast disaster unless Palestinians understand that war option has been used for last time (M) ","Palestinians can choose between war against Israel or peace talks with Israel. For the Palestinians, the use of the war option was a great success-- this time. They got immediate international support for their attacks on Israelis plus instant international condemnation of Israel for being in the way of Palestinian police bullets. Ninety percent of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza now live in cities controlled by the Palestinian Authority set up by the Oslo agreement and financed largely by international grants. So the Washington meeting will have meaning only if Mr. Clinton tells Palestinians that their war option is now a deadly mirage."

Federal Mogul Corp says it has sold its 900-employee ball bearing manufacturing operations to NTN Corp of Japan; purchase price is not announced (S) ,"The Federal Mogul Corporation, a large auto parts maker based in Southfield, Mich., announced yesterday that it had sold its 900-employee ball bearing manufacturing operations to the NTN Corporation of Osaka, Japan. No purchase price was announced for the unit, which holds an estimated 2 or 3 percent of the $ 5 billion United States bearing market. The United States imposed duties of up to 212 percent on imported bearings in 1989 because of concerns that Japanese and other foreign companies were dumping bearings on the American market. The duties, since reduced to 5 to 20 percent, have prompted foreign manufacturers to build or buy more bearing factories here. COMPANY NEWS"

Christopher D Lamb letter on Sept 27 editorial supporting New York City's workfare program ,"To the Editor: The inevitable consequences of the workfare program that you endorse in your Sept. 27 editorial will be a reduction in the number of good city jobs that pay a decent wage and the growth of a second-tier, exploited work force made up of welfare recipients receiving $ 350 to $ 450 a month and no benefits for doing the work city workers used to do. As the city expands the workfare program to meet the mandates of the new Federal welfare law, competition from these exploited welfare workers will drive down wages throughout the public job market and also in the private job market, since the new law permits assigning workfare workers to private employers. Many welfare recipients are ready and eager to work. What they need are real jobs that pay real wages."

John Calipari holds his first practice as coach of New Jersey Nets; photo (M) ,"It was John Calipari's opening practice as the Nets coach. With a five-year, $ 15 million contract as coach and executive vice president for operations, Calipari has the final say on all personnel decisions, and he enjoys more power than any Nets coach in history. But with that power comes scrutiny, and the Nets, coming off a 30- 52 season, present a challenge that would have scared some coaches away. Most National Basketball Association teams open camp on Friday, but the Nets were permitted to begin early, because they have a November trip to Tokyo for two games against the Orlando Magic. Calipari said he would hold two-a-day workouts until Friday, when he cuts back to one a day."
"Stephen Holden reviews film Predictions of Fire, written and directed by Michael Benson (S) ","As Michael Benson, an American journalist and film maker, suggests in his ominous, intellectually provocative film,'' Predictions of Fire,'' both Hitler, an art-school reject and Stalin, a self-described engineer of human souls, were dictators who established states that could be viewed as enormous works of art. Scenes of art events are interwoven with film clips of Communist and Fascist pageants from the past that forcefully illustrate the seductive power of parades and rallies. The film ends with a warning that Western Europe's detachment from the turmoil in the Balkans is a denial of its own susceptibility to the same eruptive forces.

Leon Reinharth letter on C Everett Koop's Sept 26 Op-Ed article; says abortion decisions should be left to medical profession ,"C. Everett Koop's Op-Ed article of Sept. 26 ('' Why Defend Partial-Birth Abortion?'' ) presents medical evidence to support his political position. He may or may not be right, but that evaluation should be made by members of the medical profession. The push toward governmental deregulation over the past 15 years is not aimed at eliminating standards or controls, but rather at transferring the oversight of such standards and controls to the appropriate private sector. Why is this late-term abortion method the only one where expert medical professionals are not trusted to make a proper judgment?Moreover, Dr. Koop is disingenuous when he compares abortion rights advocates to the gun lobby."

But to see the Orioles chase the Cleveland ace Charles Nagy in a 10- 4 victory against the muscle-bound Indians in the first game of their division series, to feel this good about their team made it easy to cheer even Alomar. Alomar said, referring to his statement.'' He showed patience against pitcher Paul Shuey, who came in after reliever Alan Embree hit Rafael Palmeiro to load the bases in the sixth.

The reorganization of a collective memory, the symbols adopted by societies, are all part of imagined communities creating a national self. Ironically and tragically, the other, the Palestinians to the Israelis and vice versa, is part of the formation of the national self. The curse and blessing of personal and national memory are a constant presence in the personal and national psyche.

Theodore R Mann letter says Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu must respect Palestinian national aspirations in order to secure peace ,"To the Editor: At Oslo two peoples agreed to search for a way to satisfy Palestinian national aspirations without undermining Israel's security. Yet right before last week's eruption of violence, the Israeli Government approved the construction of nearly 4,000 new homes in West Bank settlements. Those settlements are the Government's way of trying to extinguish Palestinian national aspirations. And that, not the opening of a tunnel, is what inevitably produces revolt and intifada. In 1987 Yitzhak Rabin threatened to break the bones of Palestinian rock-throwers. Yet by 1993 he embraced the Oslo accords, finally realizing that Palestinian national aspirations could not be suppressed or extinguished any more than could Jewish national aspirations 50 years ago.

Whatever one thinks of the morality or wisdom of Yasir Arafat's tactics, the current unrest in the Middle East stems from Mr. Netanyahu's attempts to perpetuate Israel's sovereignty over two million Palestinians who can not vote in Israel's elections. Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres recognized the incompatibility of that arrangement with Western democracy. Whether Mr. Netanyahu can fashion and sustain apartheid with a human face is, at best, problematic. Whether he can sell the end result as democracy should not be. JEROME M.

Let me reward them with additional prizes, just like the Palestinians. So what if they've proven our worst fears: that guns they gained from the peace process will be used against the Jews? So what if Israeli soldiers surrounded by Palestinians in a self-rule area were massacred?Not until the Palestinians prove that they want peace and can be trusted can the peace process continue.

Netanyahu has retracted, both in statement and action, previously agreed-to terms with the Palestinian Authority. Israel has restricted Palestinian movement between towns within the West Bank and Gaza, essentially disallowed the construction of homes for the Palestinian people and expelled them from the economic life of Israel. A sovereign Palestinian state is much less a threat to Israel than a suppressed, demoralized Palestinian people. I hope the prospects for real peace did not end when Yigal Amir took the life of Yitzhak Rabin."

Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General ( Op-Ed, Sept. 26 ), decries'' misinformation,'' but he uses a term,'' partial-birth abortion,'' that is unknown to medicine.

Navy Comdr Gordon Hume says last concentrated field of wreckage from Trans World Airlines Flight 800 has been cleared and scuba divers are searching for scattered fragments of jumbo jet; Federal law enforcement officials still hope to find piece of wreckage that will demonstrate what most of them believe: that bomb or missile caused plane's destruction (M) ,"Several investigators estimated that the salvage operation could be wrapped up in less than 10 days. After almost 11 weeks of a massive but inconclusive investigation, Federal law enforcement officials said they still hoped to find a piece of wreckage that would demonstrate what most of them still believed: that a bomb or, less probably, a missile most likely caused the plane's destruction. The persistent confidence that the crash was most likely sparked by an explosive device, several law enforcement officials and Federal aviation investigators said, comes in part because that explanation mostly neatly fits the available evidence. And the most important piece of physical evidence would be a piece of metal that bears the distinctive physical damage that would be caused by a bomb."

Sandra Mullin letter on anti-immigrant sentiments in US ,"To the Editor: When the Mayor of Haverstraw, N.Y., is comfortable enough to say that one of the main problems with Dominican immigrants is that'' They produce a lot of heavy garbage. I mean, rice and beans are heavy, you know'' ( news article, Sept. 30 ), let no one be mistaken that anti-immigrant sentiments, and more specifically anti-Latino sentiments, have been buoyed by the recent welfare and immigration laws. Such racist comments should provide further motivation to immigrants to naturalize, register and vote. SANDRA MULLIN Brooklyn, Sept. 30, 1996"

Fletcher says in his Sept. 29 Op-Ed piece ('' Victims' Rights and Wrongs'' ) that he would ban from the knowledge of a jury, as irrelevant to a penalty, the feelings of the family and friends of murder victims. How can we judge a murder, or murderer, without knowing the consequences, what was felt by those who suffered?Mr. Fletcher also says that who is killed is irrelevant in judging a murder. He says all murders are alike. Are we then to believe that a jury should judge a young man who kills another in a'' fair'' fistfight as equally culpable as someone who beats to death a child or old person?

Woolley, a longtime Sotheby's auctioneer who capped his sometimes staid and sonorous career by emerging as a witty and tart-tongued pitchman who wheedled, needled, cajoled and shamed his society friends into spending millions of dollars at charity auctions, died on Tuesday at the New York University Medical Center. This was simply not done in the polite world of high-level auctions.

Until he began making hilarious, often outrageous, remarks in public at charity auctions, Mr. Woolley, who joined Sotheby's in 1968, was known to friends and associates as a man who made hilarious, almost always outrageous, remarks in private."

Dave Anderson Sports of the Times column describes scene at Yankee Stadium as New York Yankees defeat Texas Rangers in second game of divisional playoff series (M) ,"JUST as ball players rise to the occasion, so do stadiums. George Steinbrenner does n't need a ball park on the West Side of Manhattan or New Jersey. He has a ball park, the best ball park. As for the age argument, since its facelift, Yankee Stadium is really only 20 years old, the same age as Giants Stadium, which nobody is saying is too old. Yankee Stadium does n't even look old. He talks about how teams with the newer old-style ball parks are drawing the most fans. But the basic attraction of any ball park is the team. When the novelty wears off, a new ball park on the West Side or in Manhattan wo n't mean much without a good team in it. Just keep Yankee Stadium where it is."

Pietroluongo of Patrol Borough Bronx, who was the on-scene commander.' Kevin M. Hallinan, the director of security for Major League Baseball, employed a similar strategy at the Stadium that was implemented earlier this season in Montreal, where Expos fans threw O'Henry candy bars onto the field after Henry Rodriguez hit a home run.

Article discusses play of Texas Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez in first two games of playoff series against New York Yankees; he has hit three home runs; photo (M) ,"In the first two games of their playoff series with the Texas Rangers, the Yankees thought they were pitching to Rene Gonzales when it really was Juan Gonzalez. Batting again the next inning, Gonzalez socked another home run off Pettitte, this one a three-run shot that gave the Yankees a 4- 1 lead. In confusing Gonzalez for Gonzales, or vice versa, whichever it is, the Yankees made a mistake with Juan for the second time. But then, if the Yankees were smart, they would n't have been pitching to Gonzalez in this series or any series during the season. Gonzalez destroyed them during the season. In his 39 plate appearances during the season, the Yankees walked Gonzalez only once."

Aug. 28 in the Rangers' 133d game, then drove in only five runs in the final 29 games.''Playing every day for the first time in five years kind of wore me out,'' said Elster, who ignited a three-run third inning with a leadoff double last night and the second Texas run on Juan Gonzalez's second home run of the game off Andy Pettitte."
Article discusses play of several New York Yankees veterans as well as rookie shortstop Derek Jeter in victory over Texas Rangers in second game of division playoff series; photo (M) ,"He sat the left-handed-hitting Darryl Strawberry against the right-hander Ken Hill after Strawberry carried an 0-for-9 mark into the post-season and had gone without a hit in Game 1 on Tuesday. To replace him at designated hitter, Torre dusted off Cecil Fielder, the lumbering former Detroit Tigers slugger, who finished the season with 6 hits in his last 12 at-bats but unhappily sat out the first game of the series. Another desperation move by Torre came in the seventh inning, when the manager saw a team that had only four hits and two runs-- on the Fielder home run-- by the bottom of the seventh. Hayes was subbing for Wade Boggs, who had gone without a hit in seven at-bats since doubling in the opening inning of the first game."
"New York Yankees defeat Texas Rangers, 5-4, in second game of division playoff series; series is tied, 1-1; photo (M) ","Somehow they survived when a simple bunt decided a complicated game. Charlie Hayes's routine sacrifice bunt to third base in the 12th inning turned into a game-winning bunt when Dean Palmer inexplicably bounced his throw past Mark McLemore at first base to allow Derek Jeter to score from second and lift the Yankees to a wild 5- 4 victory in front of 57,156 fans at Yankee Stadium late last night. The teams will take today off before resuming with Game 3 at the Ballpark in Arlington tomorrow night. Despite last night's comeback, the pressure will still be on the Yankees because they must win two of the three games in Arlington, where they have lost 10 of their last 13 games."
