Many Americans, including thousands of New Yorkers, began enjoying household plumbing as early as the 1840's even when they did not have access to city utility mains.

The uneasiness of Germans persists because unification was largely defined in material terms but not played out in emotional, historic and moral terms. Nations are not made up of economic output but of historical moments that people call their own-- moments of liberation, for example. The fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 was such a moment in German history. Instead of seizing this moment, Chancellor Helmut Kohl let the process of reunification degenerate to technicalities defined by bureaucrats.

The observations were described at a news conference at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington and are being reported in more detail in today's issue of the journal Nature.''It's the first time anyone has seen that many star-forming objects in such a small space,'' said Dr. Rogier Windhorst, an Arizona State astronomy professor and member of the discovery team.

The heartbreaking case predates the city's child welfare overhaul, but it underscores how urgently reform is needed. During that same period, a city caseworker visited the Lockwood home and made a similar finding. No move was made to remove the children. Given the tragic ending, it is hard to escape the conclusion that police and child welfare authorities failed to investigate thoroughly enough. Not even a perfect agency could prevent every wrongful death. But even more important than technology is the training, ability and aggressiveness of the child welfare workers."

Before Kinder was injured in a practice last Sunday, Holtz had said that the most likely scenario in the event of an injury at tailback would be to return Denson to his old position. The progress of the freshmen, and Denson's eventual impact at his new position, could become major factors as the Irish take on a month that could be their most difficult of the season.''If"
"Article discusses long troubled history of Carla Lockwood, who is charged with murder in starving death of her 4-year-old daughter Nadine; Lockwood family had faced homelessness and sought emergency shelter, along way became clients of highly regarded private social service agency and was aided by city housing subsidy only to be cut off later from welfare benefits and food stamps (M) ","Prison was only the last stop on Carla Lockwood's miserable family journey, one that over the years brought the troubled mother and her children into contact with far more institutions than just the city's child welfare agency. Of course, the child welfare agency should take the lead in integrating the efforts of others trying to assist troubled families. According to child welfare records, Nicole never attended school after 1994. Again, there is no evidence that the child welfare agency intervened to restore the housing grant. It is unclear if the child welfare agency was ever informed of the change in financial circumstances."

Ekeus said that a typical inspection would involve a ground team moving into a factory or other site to look for material or documents pertaining to weapons production, while a helicopter would circle above the area to watch for any movement of goods within or out of the area.''Iraq has had an active policy of concealment,'' he said. United Nations inspectors, among them experts in biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, have accused the Iraqis of moving suspect material around the country to escape detection."

But Graf has not eased through the Open in her usual summer fashion; she has lost 29 games in her first five matches. But Graf realizes her level of play is n't good enough to help her defend her Open title right now, not with a feisty 15-year-old like Martina Hingis waiting for her in the semifinals.''I've always thought the next match I would play better,'' Graf said.''"

Adelphi University Prof Norman Ashcraft letter points out that university is not on trial in ethics proceedings involving Adelphi's board and president ,"To the Editor: In your Sept. 5 news article on the start of classes at Adelphi University amid accusations of administrative wrongdoings at the school, and in your coverage of continuing hearings before the New York State Board of Regents, you omit a major point: Adelphi is not on trial. The larger issue is the impact the Adelphi situation may have on higher education. Some people think of a university as a corporation with a strict hierarchical structure. An alternative view defines the university as a special institution incorporated only to further the acquisition of knowledge through a collegial effort among various constituents. The regents' hearings are showing that Adelphi's board and president fail under both models. 1996The writer is a professor of anthropology at Adelphi University."

From its outset, this administration has been characterized by budgetary attacks on virtually all programs that might help struggling families, like income support, public education, health care, housing and homeless services, drug treatment, youth services, foster care and preventive services.

Bishop Jr. does not like insurance agents. So when he decided he needed more life insurance, he did not call his local agent; in fact, he did not pick up the phone at all. The rise of the Internet has forced them to contemplate a radical change in the traditional way of selling insurance: face to face through an army of more than 650,000 agents across the nation. But Internet insurance is now spreading beyond relatively simple term life. For all the obstacles, the pioneers of Internet insurance sales say their business is taking off.

Editorial on Democratic primaries for obscure but powerful post of Surrogate's Court judge; endorses Renee Roth for re-election in Manhattan; finds challenger Karen Burstin miscast for job that calls for tempered judicial and administrative skills; endorses Justice Michael Feinberg in Brooklyn ,"In a fierce battle in Manhattan, the incumbent Surrogate Renee Roth faces a tough re-election challenge from Karen Burstein, a former State Senator and Family Court judge who ran unsuccessfully for State Attorney General two years ago. Judge Roth, during 14 years in the Surrogate's job, has proved fair and able. But over all she has done an admirable job and boosted the court's credibility.

Editorial on milestone of handshake between new Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat ,"The awkward body language caught the spirit of Wednesday's first meeting between Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat. Despite his harsh campaign attacks on Mr. Arafat and the peace effort conducted by Israel's last two leaders, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, it is now clear that the Israelis will conduct further negotiations with the Palestinians. By meeting with Mr. Arafat, Mr. Netanyahu showed that he understands that the Likud Party's fierce animosity toward the Palestinian leader should give way to a more moderate governing posture. Granted, Mr. Netanyahu was under heavy pressure to arrange a meeting from the United States and Israel's two Middle East peace partners, Egypt and Jordan. It is premature to imagine Mr. Netanyahu leaping aboard the peace bandwagon first set in motion by an earlier Likud Prime Minister, Menachem Begin."

The Ford Motor Company reported today that its August sales slipped 6.3 percent from their strong performance a year earlier, which was in line with the weak sales reported by other auto makers earlier this week. Auto makers fear any rate increase because higher interest rates make it harder for people to afford new cars and trucks, the payments commonly financed over several years. Mr. Trotman pointed to the industry sales figures as evidence that the Fed should leave rates untouched.'' Ford's car sales slid 8.4 percent in August, while the sales of light trucks dropped 4.4 percent.

For its part, the Cuban Government has in the past limited its contacts with exile groups to those critical of American policy. Diplomats in Havana attributed the Foreign Ministry's evident unease with the debate to personal and ideological rivalries within the Cuban Government. The debate also marked a shift of attitude on the part of the Cuban American National Foundation, which in the past has criticized rival Cuban exile groups here that favor dialogue with the Cuban Government as part of a transition to the post-Castro era."
"Senate postpones vote on bill to bar Federal recognition of same-sex 'marriages,' after Republicans and Democrats fail to agree on amendments to bar discrimination against homosexuals in workplace; Sen Edward Kennedy had threatened to attach amendment to one of appropriations bills that Senate leader Trent Lott wants enacted (S) ","The Senate today postponed a vote on a bill to bar Federal recognition of same-sex marriages after Republicans and Democrats failed to agree on which amendments could be offered to the bill. This week Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, called the amendment a'' distraction'' and said he would use a procedural maneuver to prevent Democrats from offering the amendment to the marriage bill. Gay rights groups and their Senate backers said 32 senators had promised to support the anti-discrimination amendment, and they were within reach of the votes needed to approve the amendment. The underlying bill, called the Defense of Marriage Act, would allow each state to ignore same-sex marriages in any other states.

California is the 20th state in which bills have failed that would ban or deny recognition to same-sex marriages, or do both. Anticipating that decision, the United States Senate is expected to pass a bill that would deny Federal recognition and benefits to same-sex marriages and relieve states of the obligation to recognize such marriages if they are ever performed in another state, like Hawaii. But in the State Senate the bill was amended to establish legal unions outside marriage for homosexual or heterosexual couples."

"Detroit's Big Three auto makers and United Automobile Workers union reportedly consider landmark proposal to resolve dispute over moves by manufacturers to buy more auto parts from outside suppliers; under new proposal, each auto maker would agree not to let its unionized work force fall much below current levels for three or more years of next contract; in exchange, auto makers want union's permission to pay permanently lower wages in any new auto-parts businesses they may enter; deal allowing permanently lower wages in new auto-parts businesses might get around union's objections to two-tier wage structure, since workers earning lower wages would not be working in same factories as current UAW workers with higher wages, thus reducing potential for conflict among rank-and-file workers (M) ","But the proposal would allow the auto makers to build or buy factories producing auto parts that they currently buy from other companies, and to pay the same, fairly low wages in these factories as other suppliers of the same parts. But a deal that only lowers wages for the production of new products would help Ford-- and the Chrysler Corporation-- a lot more than General Motors, which already makes most of its own parts. During the last labor negotiations, in 1993, the auto makers extended the period during which they could pay lower wages to three years. The auto makers could threaten to enter any parts industry in which prices were particularly high. The new proposal would give the auto makers an incentive to manufacture parts themselves at U.A.W-organized factories rather than buy parts from outside companies."

The Iraqi leader's main goal is to cement his grip on power while reasserting it throughout Iraq, the diplomats and opposition leaders said, and the retaliation meted out by Washington did little to offset that objective. While the average Iraqi may be scrambling for food, those Mr. Hussein needs to hold onto power are Iraqi opposition figures also believe that recent international changes probably played a role in prompting Mr. Hussein to act.

Editorial suports including Ross Perot in campaign debates between Pres Clinton and Bob Dole ,"But the decision whether to include Mr. Perot, or anyone else, should be based on whether a candidacy has the earmarks of a valid national campaign. Such tests of viability include ballot position, fund-raising ability and a history of performance in previous campaigns. It could also be instructive to voters, since Mr. Perot is raising issues on trade and campaign finance reform that are not being discussed by others. This page, applying that standard in 1980, argued for the inclusion of the third-party candidate John Anderson. Debates have become a welcome tradition in modern Presidential campaigns, and the commission has performed a useful role in keeping that tradition alive. In 1992 President Bush sought to avoid debating Mr. Clinton until operatives from the Democratic campaign began dressing up in chicken outfits at his campaign rallies."

Musical America International Directory of the Performing Arts lists about 150 cellists of soloist rank as available for concertizing in a field of perhaps a couple hundred solo engagements a year with orchestras for cellists in the United States and Canada. But artists I have represented sometimes find that once they sign on with one orchestra, other major symphony orchestras are less likely to engage them as guest soloists for fear of offending their own first-rank instrumentalists. Even when such engagements are arranged, many find themselves canceling because of late scheduling conflicts in their parent orchestras."

National Defense University senior fellow Phebe Marr Op-Ed article contends that latest US military action in Iraq has left Turkey weaker and Iran stronger (M) ,"The American military has succeeded in containing Saddam Hussein in the south of Iraq, where it counts. At the same time, the American military action has failed to address Turkish concerns over an uncontrolled border with Iraq. Now Turkey has announced it will move troops into northern Iraq to establish a buffer zone along the border. Such a zone, even a temporary one, might further destabilize the situation in northern Iraq. A second cost to the United States is likely to be felt inside northern Iraq. Such moves could require new American military actions. Finally, in the Arab world, support for Iraq, if not for Mr. Hussein, may have been strengthened by the air strikes. It must stabilize permanently Iraq's frontier with Turkey and prevent further Iranian moves into northern Iraq."

"Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System Inc, will receive much lower pay package than had been anticipated after Time Warner Inc acquires his company; proxy statement released for merged companies shows that Turner, who will become vice chairman at Time Warner under chairman Gerald M Levin, will receive package valued at $23 million in salary and bonus and 2.2 million options for Time Warner stock over five years; that is far below initial reports of a package worth roughly $100 million over that same period (M) ","Time Warner plans to transform WTBS into a cable service. As the deal is now structured, the companies plan to spin off Southern Satellite Systems into a separate company that will hold Liberty's Time Warner stock. But since tax payments are deductible to Time Warner, the cost to the company is roughly the same. Time Warner also anticipates receiving revenues of about $ 100 million annually from cable operators once WTBS is distributed by cable. The Federal Trade Commission has mandated that Time Warner carry a second news channel alongside Turner's Cable News Network. The proxy shows that if Time Warner continues to carry the MSNBC cable news channel on its systems, the service must be available in 50 percent of its homes by 1999."

Britain abandons efforts to pass United Nations resolution critical of Iraq for its attack on Kurdish town of Erbil (S) ,"Britain today abandoned efforts to pass a resolution critical of Iraq for its attack on the Kurdish town of Erbil a week ago. The decision not to force a vote on even a watered-down resolution expressing only'' deep concern'' about the use of Iraqi forces in an area under international protection was made after Russia refused to withdraw the threat of a veto. Russia wanted some criticism of the American missile strikes on Iraq that followed the Iraqi action at Erbil. The American use of force made it harder to garner votes condemning President Saddam Hussein, diplomats said. RAID ON IRAQ"

Yousef could not press witnesses too hard about computers or explosives without looking like an expert himself. Mr. Shah's lawyer, David S. Greenfield, and Mr. Murad's lawyer, Clover M.

While wages have been creeping up, most companies have reported an inability to push through price increases to customers, keeping inflation quiescent. Still, to liberal economists, the current balance between employment and inflation is showing the inflation hawks at the Federal Reserve to be overly cautious about the economy's capacity to generate jobs and non-inflationary wage increases."

Laura D Harckham letter disputes William Fitzgerald Sept 1 letter stating that there is no proven link between college performance and SAT results ,"To the Editor: William Fitzgerald ( letter, Sept. 1 ) is wrong when he states that'' there is no proven link between college performance and S.A.T. results.'' Colleges use Scholastic Assessment Test scores as an admissions criterion because studies have demonstrated a correlation between the scores and first-year college achievement. Parents and colleges invest too much in tuition to permit the admission of students predicted to fail. Because there are many factors that contribute to success in college, S.A.T. scores should not be used as the sole determinant of admission, but they do offer valuable information about an applicant's chances of success that should not be discounted.
