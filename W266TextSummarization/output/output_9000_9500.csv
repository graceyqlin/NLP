"Ludmilla Chiriaeff, founder of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens of Montreal and major force in Canadian dance, dies at age 72; photo (M) ","Ludmilla Chiriaeff, the founder of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens of Montreal and a major force in Canadian dance, died on Sunday at a hospital in Montreal. Chiriaeff developed a major company in a city that knew little about ballet before her arrival there in 1952. Chiriaeff persevered, and, in addition to building a company, she became a pioneer of dance on Canadian television and a leader of Canadian dance education. Chiriaeff grew up in Berlin, where she received her first ballet lessons. Chiriaeff decided to transform it into a company for Canadian theaters. The City of Montreal proclaimed her a'' Grande Montrealaise ( Great Montrealer )'' in 1978, and the headquarters of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens is called La Maison de la Danse Ludmilla Chiriaeff in her honor."
"Editorial opposes Bob Dole's plan to cut everyone's income tax rates by 15 percent and to throw in extra $500 cut for every child up to age 18; notes that group of over 500 economists have called Dole's proposal 'economically reckless'; contends that Pres Clinton's proposal to cut taxes also makes little economic sense, but maintain's that his plan is too small to do great harm (M) ","Bob Dole wants to cut everyone's income tax rates by 15 percent and throw in an extra $ 500 cut for every child up to age 18-- a startling 70 percent reduction for a family with two children earning about $ 30,000. These tax cuts are also tantalizing, but they too make little economic sense, as some of his own advisers admit in private. The Dole plan specifically names numerous tax cuts. Tax cuts can lift an economy out of recession. The Reagan tax cuts did not achieve these goals. Poor families who owe no tax can not take advantage of a child tax credit. Nor will Mr. Clinton's proposal to enlarge a tax credit for companies that hire welfare recipients atone for his signing the Republican welfare bill. Now he proposes sprinkling inconsequential tax cuts."
"Discovery of huge stock of Irish Republican Army explosives and weapons by police in London on Sept 23 seriously wounds peace effort in Northern Ireland, but does not kill it, according to Irish and British officials and independent analysts (M) ","The discovery of a huge stock of I.R.A. explosives and weapons by the police in London on Monday has seriously wounded the peace effort in Northern Ireland, but did not kill it, Irish and British officials and independent analysts said today. Most agreed in interviews with the assessment of David Ervine, head of the Progressive Unionist Party, a small Protestant group, that'' there is no peace process'' now under way that is likely to produce an imminent breakthrough in the effort toward a political solution of decades of sectarian violence in the predominantly Protestant British province. Sinn Fein has been excluded from the Belfast talks by the British and Irish Governments, which stipulate that the I.R.A. must first restore the 1994 cease-fire it broke in February with a series of bomb attacks in England."

Egyptian newspapers and officials have sharply assailed the new Israeli Government in recent weeks. Netanyahu, on a visit to Britain, said,'' It saddens me when I hear these expressions from Egypt, because Egypt was our first peace partner.''In the meantime a new Arab-Israeli row took shape when the Israeli authorities opened a second entrance to tunnels that run along the western wall of the Temple Mount. Earlier Israeli efforts to open a second entrance in 1988 led to violent Palestinian protests, forcing Israel to abandon the project at the time."

State regulators were then receiving the first complaints of improper insurance sales practices by Prudential. Neither Mr. Weiss, the lawyer who negotiated the settlement, nor Prudential executives would estimate how many policyholders might make claims or how much the company might ultimately pay in compensation."

His lawyers have said that the gifts at issue in today's verdict were not covered by the gratuities laws because they were given to Mr. Espy by Richard Douglas, a senior vice president at Sun-Diamond who was a close friend.

"Senate, 88-10, approves $1 billion in subsidies over 10 years for nation's private merchant-marine fleet; critics score bill, already passed by House and backed by Pres Clinton, as example of 'corporate welfare' and pork-barrel politics; program replaces much larger Depression-era subsidies set to expire in 1997 (M) ","The Senate today overwhelmingly approved a new plan for $ 1 billion in subsidies over 10 years for the nation's private merchant-marine fleet.

Under the new program, eligible ship operators will receive a flat payment of $ 2.3 million a ship in the fiscal year 1996 and $ 2.1 million a ship for each fiscal year through 2005. Of those 17, only 6 container ships had received a subsidy under the program that would be phased out."
"House and Senate negotiators approve immigration bill that stiffens border enforcement, speeds deportation of aliens who are criminals and restricts public benefits to legal immigrants (M) ","That provision will be changed to exempt all illegal immigrant children who are enrolled in school as of next July, and will be voted on as a separate bill. ( Page A19.$)In a contentious meeting at the Capitol, virtually every Democrat on the conference committee criticized several provisions in the immigration bill that they said would hurt legal immigrants. This could allow Democrats to change provisions in the bill they dislike. But the strategy backfired when many Republicans, particularly those in states with many illegal immigrants, like California, decided it better served their interests to have an immigration bill approved. Critics said the bill also weakens anti-discrimination provisions protecting legal workers and deletes enhanced penalties against employers who hire illegal immigrants."

Jane Waldfogel letter responds to William Safire Sept 23 column on Family and Medical Leave Act ,"To the Editor: William Safire ( column, Sept. 23 ) is correct that some people entitled to time off from work under the Family and Medical Leave Act hesitate to take it, for fear it might jeopardize prospects for advancement. Without the coverage provided by the law, the choice might be whether to take care of oneself or a family member at the risk of losing the job, or to neglect one's health or family responsibilities and keep the job. Covered workers are more likely to stay with employers over the course of life events such as childbirth or family illnesses, and their earnings are higher and career prospects are brighter as a result. 1996The writer is an assistant professor, Columbia U.

While what Mr. Safire says may hold true for some, there are those who are content with the positions they hold and who benefit from knowing that they might be able to take time off in an emergency or as a new parent without jeopardizing their jobs.

Sen Alfonse D'Amato supports Sept 21 editorial urging Senate to reconsider any contemplated rollback of 1991 Truth in Savings Act ,"To the Editor: Your Sept. 21 editorial'' Honesty in Banking'' urges the Senate, and me as the Banking Committee chairman, to reconsider any contemplated rollback of the 1991 Truth in Savings Act. Last fall the committee unanimously passed legislation that retains the requirement that banks uniformly advertise an annual percentage yield. The final Senate spending bill does not do away with the disclosures that consumers might use in deciding where to deposit their money. It is to be hoped that the bill will also contain provisions that will protect taxpayers from having to finance another savings and loan bailout and that will improve credit report accuracy and privacy. In recent years I have fought against high credit-card interest rates, double automatic teller machine surcharges and mortgage scams directed at elderly and working-class homeowners."

Neil O'Donnell discusses problems his New York Jets are having on offense (M) ,"But in this 0- 4 season, O'Donnell finds himself with a personal record few in the National Football League could have thought possible.

Nilesh K Shah letter responds to Sept 19 article on Treasury Dept's concerns about electronic money laundering and counterfeiting on Internet ,"To the Editor: Your Sept. 19 Business Day article on a Treasury Department conference to address concerns about electronic money laundering and counterfeiting on the Internet raises important issues. But except for Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's reference to tax evasion, you barely touch on the issue of taxing Internet transactions. With millions of dollars at stake, revenue-starved countries will be clamoring to tax transactions conducted over the Internet. Proposals to tax these transactions will not work. Location and jurisdiction as criteria for taxation of transactions will only create new tax havens. Another flawed policy would be to impose a regional tax on income earned worldwide or to apply a value-added tax, which would be almost impossible to enforce."

' We've been hungry for a test for this disease. Scientists have debated for more than a decade about the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The new test does not identify the agent, but rather works by detecting a substance in spinal fluid, 14-3- 3 protein, which is thought to leak from brain cells damaged by Creutzfeldt-Jakob or mad-cow disease. In suspected cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the new test is valuable because it allows diagnosis without subjecting the patient to brain surgery."

It is used only in late-term abortions, after 20 weeks of gestation. Whatever one's views of late-term abortions, this bill is not a serious effort to confront the issue directly. Rather, it is the first shot in a campaign by anti-abortion forces to erode access to abortion by banning one procedure after another."

As he has since Iowa last winter, the more Mr. Dole campaigns, the more voters he drives away. Mr. Dole's introductory music was'' Play That Funky Music, White Boy'' and the Beatles''' Tax Man.'' A Dole advance man in the back sent up a few wistful puffs from a little smoke-blowing machine. It's not entirely the Dole campaign's fault. Bill Clinton presents a target unprecedented in American politics: a perpetual-motion machine, moving left, right and center, signing bills to please one constituency and promising to fix the bills he just signed to please another constituency. It is a little poignant to watch, this lion-in-autumn performance by a man who dedicated his life to public service."
Joyce Purnick Metro Matters column discusses new television series Spin City and its depiction of fictional city hall; photo (M) ,"There it was, with Michael J. Fox as a deputy mayor in his fictional City Hall. America, this is not really City Hall, at least not as depicted in Tuesday's episode and two others. City Hall is rarely a funny place, mayors are nothing like the foggy-brained Mayor Randall Winston on'' Spin City,'' and first deputy mayors do not look or act like Michael J. Fox. Deputy Mayors work very, very hard. That is the job of first deputy mayors. Not that deputy mayors are all work. It is the nature of City Hall that everybody always knows these personal factoids. City Hall is sort of a small town contained in a building. Just as there are no laugh tracks in City Hall."

House approves one bill that would crack down on illegal immigration and another that would allow states to deny public education to any illegal immigrant children who are not enrolled in school by next July (M) ,"The House today approved one bill that would crack down on illegal immigration and another that would allow states to deny a public education to any illegal immigrant children who are not enrolled in school by next July. The overall immigration bill is likely to be approved in some form by the Senate and signed by President Clinton. Indeed, the Senate may not even take a separate vote on the immigration conference report the House approved.

"Susan Koshy letter responds to Bharati Mukherjee Sept 22 Op-Ed article, Two Ways to Belong in America ","To the Editor: Bharati Mukherjee's fable of immigrant identity ( Op-Ed, Sept. 22 ) accords with right-wing arguments that it is not quite ethical for legal immigrants to accept economic benefits from the United States without assuming citizenship. The net loss to these countries when such people leave for the developed world is enormous, and it is the economic benefit to the industrialized world-- not charity and good will-- that has kept immigration of skilled workers open. It is hardly surprising that no less than Bill Gates of Microsoft spoke to Congress about the critical need for big business to maintain the supply of skilled immigrants. Finally, while Ms. Mukherjee's American experience may have taught her to put references to caste purity in quotation marks, she has not been able to relinquish caste as a distinguishing mark."

The great Cuban pianist Chucho Valdes, who will be performing with the band through Sunday, sat in for a few pieces, and Anga, the Cuban percussionist, added raps and tapping and eruptions to the sound of the band. Mr. Lacy's piece used the big, dissonant sound of John Coltrane's'' Africa Brass,'' but with more harmony; pinched, burnt trumpet shouts engulfed the soloists. When he soloed, Mr. Valdes pieced together an elaborate edifice out of ostinatos, spinning figures, repetitions and clusters that defined the possibilities of the modern piano, and made the band members look on with admiration."

Mr. Hurt, yet another pianist from Memphis, has an exploratory personality and sounds resolutely like himself. Carlon, a Smalls regular, is the tall, quiet type; he does n't play much. It was Mr. Hurt and the band, including Neal Caine on bass and Alvester Garnett on drums, that brought the music its charge. Performing with Mr. Caine and occasionally Mr. Garnett, Mr. Hurt leads the Monday night jam sessions at Smalls, and he has a group concept. Hurt's sure sense of time allowed outrageous play on his part, rhythmic gestures that would have sent most bands spinning out of control."

The empanada cabrales was an elegant contrast, a mixture of the great Spanish blue cheese, warm pastry and greens in a dark walnut-pear vinaigrette reminiscent of balsamic vinegar. Try the flan, with its deep milky taste, or the raspberry sorbet with its hint of cinnamon. Or for sheer flavor shock, the powerful tamarind sorbet. I particularly like the Colombian arepa, a sweet corncake topped with pulled beef and a really spicy green tomato sauce."

Is $ 260 billion enough to meet our current military needs? Certainly, this country has the greatest military superiority of any nation in modern times. Another factor that is largely ignored by Mr. Rauch is that the United States has many important needs, currently unmet, that could be financed by reductions in military expenditures; to put this another way, increases in military spending lead to cuts in nonmilitary expenditures."

One provision of the bill, for example, misleadingly labeled'' exclusive jurisdiction,'' would in fact bar any court from hearing any challenge to decisions by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to commence and adjudicate proceedings. The courts have enjoined the I.N.S. from proceeding, finding that the agency selectively enforced the deportation laws against my clients in retaliation for their peaceful, First Amendment-protected activities-- like distributing literature, holding demonstrations and raising money for humanitarian aid.

"Amy M Spindler reviews exhibit, Two by Two, at Costume Institute of Metropolitan Museum of Art, NYC; show deals with women's and men's fashions from 18th century to 1970's; photo (L) ","Sometimes, as with French court dress from 1730, the men's clothes ape the women's, struggling to take up as much space and flaunt as much ornamentation. At other times, the austere men's clothes, like those from 1868, ridicule the frivolity of women's lacy, voluminous dress. Because women were so powerful in court, men's dress mimicked feminine decorative touches. Inspired by the breakdown of classes after the French Revolution, men and women dressed to defy conventions the court had set. As men became successful in business and finance, women adopted elements of their dress, just as men borrowed from women's dress in the French court. It sets forth the contemporary notion of men and women dressing alike."

Comment on some gimmicks New York City real-estate brokers employ in their efforts to get more listings of properties for sale (M) ,"Customers abound in a rising real estate market, but what brokers really need are listings, or properties for sale.

Halstead, head of the real estate company that bears his name.''The lawyers nixed the idea,'' Mr. Halstead said.''

"Holland Cotter reviews exhibit Guardians of the Sacred Word at Barbara Mathes Gallery, NYC; show offers 30 wooden covers made for manuscript containers in Tibet between 12th and 15th centuries; photo (L)&#xFFFD; ","In the Himalayan kingdoms of Tibet and Nepal, new monasteries had sprung up, and the Indian tradition of copying and illuminating manuscripts had been given new life. The bright spark of that tradition comes alive in'' Guardians of the Sacred Word'' at the Barbara Mathes Gallery, a resplendent surprise of a show that offers 30 wooden covers made for manuscript containers in Tibet between the 12th and 15th centuries. Hand-copied books enjoyed a privileged role in Buddhist life. A close look from piece to piece reveals a charmed menagerie of swans and lions and sea creatures, their features often merging to produce new forms. Such images on manuscript covers were surely meant to be auspicious and protective, though in time that protection was sorely tested."

Preview of New York Jets' game against Washington Redskins (M) ,"So today they made a move that could jump-start the team Sunday night at Washington. The Jets' kick-return team, the poorest in the National Football League, is affecting the offense. It ranks last in the league in field position. They rank among the bottom half-dozen teams in kickoff coverage, punt coverage and punt retuns. Last year's 3- 13 team, though, did considerably better. The special teams have committed 12 penalties, an outlandish 8 against the Colts. The penalties, said Rose, have deflated the team's poor return averages and inflated the opposition's but'' it will even out,'' he said. Every morning, the special teams players march in at 8 o'clock. That's what we're missing.''It's always something on losing teams."

Also, she will probably undergo shoulder surgery next month, so the Fed Cup could be her final event of the 1996 season."

Almost every Arab government rules despite its people, not because of them. Morally and politically these governments have given their domestic dissidents the right to kill them. If the U.S. warns Israel against creating'' new issues'' by opening another gate, the various American militia have the right to use guns if Washington orders provocative new taxes or regulations. Are the condemners saying Israel had no legal right to open a second gate to a tunnel in its own capital? Yasir Arafat and Israel's Labor Government agreed to the new gate in January."
Letter by Salvadoran Amb Ana Cristina Sol on Sept 13 editorial; says peace process and democracy will not be slowed down by changes in political leadership ,"To the Editor: Your Sept. 13 editorial'' Thunder on El Salvador's Right'' expresses concern that recent changes within our country's ruling conservative party threaten the peace process and democracy. The process will not be slowed down or derailed because of occasional changes in political-party leadership or other temporary circumstances, which can not alter that El Salvador is now ruled by its voters. Similarly, we will not tolerate abuses by either right or left extremists. We have achieved success in implementing peace, strengthening democratic institutions and reunifying the people. It would be a mistake to believe that this could somehow be imperiled by the departure of the United Nations or threats from extremists.

The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 17/32, to 9811/32. Bond prices were also bolstered by a Treasury five-year-note auction. But prices were chiefly supported by a report showing orders for durable goods fell 3.1 percent in August, after rising a revised 1.4 percent in July. Without transportation, the durables orders were down 1.6 percent. While the July report had raised worries that the economy was strengthening, yesterday's Commerce Department report dispelled fears.''Although durable goods orders tend to be erratic, the signs of a manufacturing slowdown are emerging,'' said Kenneth J.

She gave me the sexual harassment policy, and proceeded to tell Johnathan what he did was wrong. Prevette has a copy of the school's policy on'' student-to-student sexual harassment,'' which she says was given to her by the principal. But it appears to closely follow Federal definitions of sexual harassment. Under Federal education law, schools at all levels are required to have policies for dealing with sexual harassment.

"Editorial on danger of air bags to infants and young childrn sitting in front passenger seat; says air bags are too valuable to give up while designs are perfected, so that most important defense is parental insistence that children sit in rear seats ","The air bag, one of the foremost safety advances of the automobile age, can be dangerous to infants and children who sit in the front passenger seat. In two dozen accidents over the past three years, a passenger-side air bag has inflated with the explosive force needed to save an adult from injury-- but has killed a child. Seven infants in rear-facing baby seats were killed when the bag, expanding in less than a second at 200 times the force of gravity, slammed against the seat, crushing or inflicting brain damage on the child. Engineers are working on technical improvements that would slow the bag's expansion or deactivate the bag when weight or distance sensors indicate a child is in the front seat. Meanwhile, air bags are too valuable to abandon."
"Market Place column notes cash inflows into mutual funds that invest in stocks continue to surge, especially in high-yield mutual funds, meaning junk-bond funds; net inflows of $1.68 billion in August put junk-bond funds on track for their best year ever; analyst says strong inflows to junk bonds can be partly attributed to greater investment in all kinds of mutual funds; another factor is unusually low default rate for junk bonds (M) ","CASH inflows into mutual funds that invest in stocks, having bounced back in August, continued to surge in September. Junk-bond funds are a bright spot in an otherwise moribund bond market, where net inflows to all types of bond funds totaled just $ 1.7 million in August. Through August, bond funds had taken in a net $ 7.6 billion, in contrast to net outflows of $ 4.7 billion last year. If inflows maintain that rate through the year's end, junk-bond funds will record net inflows of more than $ 10 billion for 1996, eclipsing the 1986 record of $ 9.6 billion. Cash flows to international stock funds have been flat, while bond funds are recording slight net inflows."
"Editorial calls on Congressional leaders Trent Lott and Newt Gingrich to secure final approval of plan to preserve Sterling Forest on New York-New Jersey border; warns that popular measure is tucked into huge package of legislation, and could lose out because of more controversial provisions ","Perversely, Sterling Forest has been victimized by its own popularity. This big bill includes a controversial proposal authorizing corporate sponsorship for the national parks, an idea with some support in the Administration but very little backing among environmentalists, who fear that it would give Congress an excuse to provide even less funding for the parks than it does now. One would threaten the Tongass National Forest in Alaska. In its present form, the omnibus parks bill is almost certain to fail, dragging Sterling Forest down with it. That is to attach Sterling Forest to the temporary funding bill that Congress must pass before it adjourns in order to keep the government going. It may also be the last chance for Sterling Forest."

For Mr. Netanyahu, the problem is more complex. The Israeli leader accused the Palestinian of incitement, while Mr. Arafat accused Mr. Netanyahu of deliberate provocation in opening a new entrance to the tunnel, which is designed to permit tourists to view archeological relics more conveniently. Both have a case: The tunnel is hardly the terrible desecration of Islamic holies that the Palestinians charged, or the'' bedrock of our existence'' that Mr. Netanyahu claimed."

City Hall says the program may have to expand to 60,000 workers over the next year. Mayor Giuliani complains that the transit contract undermines his promise not to replace city workers with welfare recipients. The city should show some sensitivity to union concerns and to the legitimate demand by the welfare workers for protection on working conditions and wages. But the city can also offer positive incentives, such as extra pay for public employees who supervise or train welfare workers. Mr. Giuliani should also try harder to place welfare recipients in private jobs, since the city can not itself afford to employ all the welfare recipients who have to find jobs under the new law."

This is in line with Mr. Camdessus' original proposal that gold sales provide half the I.M.F. share of the plan's cost-- also being borne by the World Bank, with national contributions making up the rest. And they recalled that at the I.M.F.'s 50th anniversary meeting in Madrid two years ago, Mr. Camdessus had split the members with a proposal to increase the fund's financial importance by allowing it to issue special drawing rights worth $ 53 billion."
"Editorial calls on Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu to encourage peace in hopes of quelling Palestinian violence; says he must have cooperation of Yasir Arafat, who bears considerable responsibility for disturbances ","Without Israel's commitment to move ahead with the peace effort and agreements signed under Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Mr. Arafat can not deliver the benefits he has promised to the Palestinians. He will quickly lose whatever authority he retains, and there will be little hope of checking Palestinian unrest, save the use of Israeli force. Israel should terminate the construction work in the old city of Jerusalem that provoked the Palestinian rioting. Mr. Netanyahu should declare his intention to proceed with withdrawal of most Israeli forces from the West Bank city of Hebron, as stipulated in the second Israeli peace accord with the Palestinians. In the last few years when terrorist bombings and other crises threatened the developing peace, Israeli and Palestinian leaders found a way to overcome the problems."

An average of 54 such infants a month live in New Jersey hospitals under the care of state child welfare officials. Governor Whitman said.'' In New Jersey, the average hospital stay for'' boarder babies'' is three weeks. For babies waiting to be put in foster care, the average stay is two months. Waldman attributed the long hospital stays to a shortage of foster homes and the state's inability to determine quickly whether relatives of some infants might make suitable alternative guardians."

During the legislative battles of Mr. Clinton's first two years-- over health care, the budget, taxes and trade-- there was much grumbling and disagreement among Democratic lawmakers. After the midterm election of 1994, when Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years, there was open talk of mutiny. Even now, there are strains over issues like welfare, with many Democratic House members holding more liberal views than the President. Schumer acknowledged that there remained strains between Congressional Democrats and the White House."

The 1981 Yankees won a split-season title during a strike year and then collapsed in the World Series. This is heresy to say, but even without good old Don Mattingly, these Yankees have had the most soul, the most character, of any New York baseball team since the 1986 Mets, the team that was going to win half a dozen World Series before it grew old, and never reached another one.

Just two years ago, Republican Congressional candidates were all too eager to promote their party's leaders, putting a national cast to their races and depicting Mr. Clinton as the villain. Another unexpected dynamic this year is the like-minded interests between Mr. Clinton and Republican Congressional candidates, with each offering themselves as a guard against the other. Just the same, Mr. Dole almost never utters the word'' Gingrich'' these days, and many Republican Congressional candidates, worried that Mr. Dole will lose, offer themselves as a check on the Democrat in the White House."

But a leading Democrat on immigration issues, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, said she wanted the immigration bill approved. Under the immigration bill, a sponsor would have to earn 140 percent of the poverty level, or $ 21,788 for a family of four, to bring a spouse or minor children into the country. According to the forum's analysis, 36 percent of the citizens who sponsored their young immigrant children in 1994 would have been unable to do so under the new bill. Forty-four percent of the citizens who sponsored immigrant parents, siblings or adult children would have been prevented from bringing in their relatives under the new bill."

Mad.61 was run by Pino Luongo, whose business relationship with the Pressmans wound up in a bitter financial dispute.''My father was very humble and normally would n't want to take credit for anything, but there was a moment three years ago when we were going to open Fred's Place, a restaurant on the eighth floor, and he was pleased by that,'' Gene Pressman said yesterday.

"Roberta Smith reviews exhibit of art of Lyle Ashton Harris at Jack Tilton Gallery, NYC (S)l ","The Watering Hole' Jack Tilton Gallery 49 Greene Street, near Broome Street SoHo Through Oct. 5In , Lyle Ashton Harris is taking himself out of the picture, moving beyond portraiture and self-portraiture and treating the theme of black homosexuality in less autobiographical terms. There is an incendiary power to this new work, even if the wattage is not entirely his own. One wall is covered with photographic wallpaper that brings to mind Robert Gober: a pattern derived from repeating images of the artist, posed like a graceful and vulnerable gazelle over a watering hole. Harris's somewhat scary patchwork style trades too heavily in sensational images and is also redolent of other artists, from 19th-century trompe-l'oeil painting through Johns and Rauschenberg to David Salle."

"Newly released documents concerning Radio Free Europe broadcasts during 1956 Hungarian uprising against Soviets confirm what many Hungarians remember and others suspected: commentators encouraged Hungarians to battle on in false understanding that they would receive reinforcements from West; main item shedding new light on broadcasts is internal Radio Free Europe memorandum written by William Griffith, then political adviser at Munich-based station, few weeks after rebellion was crushed; photo (M) ","Newly released documents concerning Radio Free Europe broadcasts during the 1956 Hungarian uprising against the Soviets confirm what many Hungarians remembered and others suspected: that commentators encouraged the Hungarians to battle on in the false understanding that they would receive reinforcements from the West. At the time of the revolt, Radio Free Europe was covertly financed in part by the Central Intelligence Agency. Radio Free Europe was then exonerated. The new material, which includes minutes of Hungarian Cabinet meetings with Prime Minister Imre Nagy, the Communist reform leader, as well as notes from Politburo meetings in the Soviet Union during the crisis, was disclosed here today at a conference of American, Hungarian and Russian historians. Gati said the Hungarian Government had made some progress, but not enough.''"
Passengers and crew members who flew from Athens to New York on Trans World Airlines plane that later exploded after leaving NY say they told investigators probing whether bomb was planted during that leg of journey that there was no unusual activity on flight; law enforcement official says no solid leads have emerged from interviews; photo (M) ,"When Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded shortly after taking off from Kennedy International Airport on July 17, one of the theories investigators pursued was that a bomb was planted on the plane as it flew from Athens to New York earlier that day and set to detonate on the next leg of the plane's journey. A flight attendant testified that Mr. Yousef switched seats during the flight and acted oddly. But passengers and crew members on the July 17 Athens-to-New York flight have apparently reported no such suspicious activity. Passengers on the Athens-to-New York flight, which was designated Flight 881, said that when investigators had come to interview them, they appeared to have no hard leads. How was the flight?'"
Federal judge refuses to dismiss lawsuit against IRS brought by 737 former IBM employees who contend that part of their severance payments should not have been taxed; decision allows lawsuit to proceed; case reviewed (S) ,"A Federal judge refused today to dismiss a lawsuit against the I.R.S. brought by 737 former I.B.M. employees who contend that part of their severance payments should not have been taxed. The suit contends that a portion of the employees' severance payments was not wages, which are taxable, but settlements of potential personal injury claims for emotional distress and other wrongs. The suit, he said,'' gives special treatment to downsized employees and burdens taxpayers.''Mr. More than 120,000 former I.B.M. employees who paid $ 2.3 billion in taxes may be eligible to join the lawsuit if they file refund claims with the I.R.S., said James T.

"Italy, in signal of its new determination to join first round of countries entering Europe's monetary union, begins debate on $41 billion budget for 1997 that would effectively halve state deficit (M) ","In a signal of its new determination to join the first round of countries entering Europe's monetary union, Italy's center-left Government today began debate on a $ 41 billion budget for 1997 that would effectively halve the state deficit. But Mr. Prodi's Government is heavily dependent on the remnants of Italy's old Communist Party-- the mainstream Party of the Democratic Left, which is in government, and the hard-line Communist Refounding, which is not-- for popular support, a fact that makes further deep cuts in Italy's generous social security system politically difficult."

The mechanic, Bartholomew Torpey, 34, is accused of failing to install the exhaust pipe properly on a pool heater in the basement of the pool house where Mr. Gerulaitis was a guest on the estate of a friend, Martin Raynes, a real estate developer.

Not hockey players, not soccer players, not lacrosse players. Walk through the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and you'll see a motley collection of blues shouters, folk strummers, soul testifiers, country rockers and latter-day beat poets. It is also hypermasculine; the women who survive in this environment are like the black performers who survive in country music: ultra-conformist. But rock-and-roll used to have a different meaning. Along with her fellow Canadian Neil Young, as well as James Taylor, Carly Simon and Carole King, Joni Mitchell made music that drove many rock fans up the wall."

Colombian Government blames pilot error for crash of American Airlines jet into mountain near Cali last December; calls for new cockpit instruments and changes in navigation charts and computer software to prevent another accident (S) ,"The Colombian Government said today that the crash of an American Airlines jet that flew into a mountain near Cali in December resulted from pilot errors. But the Government also called for new cockpit instruments and for changes in navigation charts and computer software that it said would help prevent another accident. The conclusion about pilot error is certain to renew a debate about cockpit automation and pilot training. The wind was calm, the report said, so the air-traffic controller offered the crew an unusual route to save time with a more direct approach to the Cali airport, rather than to loop around. The crew accepted this suggestion but did not have enough time to prepare for the altered approach, the report said. The error put the plane on the wrong course, to Romeo."

In the weeks leading up to the vote, Mr. Jammeh's Government outlawed the country's main opposition parties, muzzled the press, forbade meetings between rival candidates and foreign diplomats and used soldiers to attack opposition rallies. Three people were killed and dozens wounded in one such attack against Mr. Darboe's final rally in a suburb of the capital. Jammeh had received military training in the United States shortly before his he seized power in 1994 by overthrowing the longtime President, Dawda Jawara, who had presided over one of the continent's oldest democracies."

Federal court orders stay on new Govt telephone regulations so that GTE Corp and other local phone companies could present oral arguments against rules (M) ,"A Federal court ordered a stay on new Government telephone regulations yesterday so that the GTE Corporation and other local phone companies could present oral arguments against the rules. GTE and other local phone companies, which filed a series of lawsuits against the Federal Communications Commission rules earlier this month, immediately applauded the decision, although several executives noted that a temporary stay was not the equivalent of a rejection of the regulations. The rules, which were adopted by the F.C.C. on Aug. 8, set the terms and conditions by which local phone companies must open their networks to new competitors such as long-distance carriers and cable-television operators. We feel good about this.''In its order, the court said it hoped to rule on the merits of the phone companies' case by January 1997."
Baby boomers' interest in gardening fuels growth of both specialty catalogues and big home garden and nursery centers; retailers add teak furniture and goatskin gloves to their basic inventory of plants and tools; lawn-and-garden spending has nearly doubled from $12.0 billion in 1985 to $22.2 billion in 1995; photo of scene at Smith &amp; Hawken store; company is known for its upscale catalogues; other photos; charts (M) ,"baby-boom generation embraced gardening in the 80's as millions of first-time home buyers set about decorating their yards as well as houses. But their penchant for following fashion in all aspects of life helped retailers by adding teak furniture and goat skin gloves to the basic inventory of plants and tools in catalogues and garden centers. In 1979 David Smith and Paul Hawken began importing English gardening tools and selling them by catalogue from Mill Valley, Calif. Now, with at least two dozen catalogues dedicated to gardening, mail-order companies are testing a variety of strategies to stand out from the pack. Surveys by the National Gardening Association show, for example, that 18 million households bought gardening supplies in home centers in 1995, compared with just 10 million in 1985."
"Editorial notes that House ethics committee has voted unanimously to broaden its investigation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich; contends that new action is encouraging sign that committee's Republican chairwoman, Nancy Johnson, and her colleagues are finally willing to bring case to honorable conclusion; maintains that House, instead of voting to adjourn, should go out on recess and return after election to finish its job on Gingrich case (M) ","A House ethics committee that had appeared paralyzed by partisan bickering has taken a startling step in its long-stalled investigation of Speaker Newt Gingrich. The committee of five Republicans and five Democrats voted unanimously to broaden its inquiry, adding four new charges against Mr. Gingrich. These include two new tax issues, the question of whether Mr. Gingrich improperly used the staff and facilities of a private foundation and, potentially most damaging, the question of whether Mr. Gingrich has lied to the committee. But that will not do for the new charges. Should the committee determine that Mr. Gingrich lied, it would infuriate those who stuck their necks out to defend him. There is no reason to drag this uncertainty into the new Congress and a new ethics committee."
"Editorial contends that upbeat report by Census Bureau on family incomes and poverty shows that recovery is finally raising living standards for American families, rich and poor; maintains that recent gains, though welcome, should be kept in perspective; notes that poverty would have to fall four more years at last year's rate just to reach level that was achieved 23 years ago (M) ","Income of the typical household rose by almost 3 percent last year, the largest increase in a decade. For the typical black family, income last year was $ 3,000 higher than in 1992. Child poverty fell faster than in any year since the mid-1970's. Even the nation's stubbornly high level of inequality fell more last year than in any year since the late 1960's. Ordinarily, there would be nothing surprising about rising income and falling poverty in the fifth year of a recovery. Poverty would have to fall four more years at last year's rate just to reach the level that was achieved 23 years ago. Black poverty last year, the lowest in recorded history, remains far worse than white poverty."
Lawyers for Ramona Africa are appealing Federal court's dismissal of jury finding that Philadelphia officials were personally liable for fire that killed members of radical group Move; Judge Louis Pollak ruled that former police and fire commissioners had no malicious intent (S) ,"Lawyers for Ramona Africa are appealing the Aug. 28 ruling that dismissed a jury finding that the city's former police commissioner and fire commissioner were personally liable for a fire that killed 11 people and destroyed an entire city block. Africa is the only adult survivor of the fire, which was ignited by city officials in 1985 in a standoff between police and members of the radical group Move. Jurors ordered the city to pay $ 1.5 million in damages to the three plaintiffs and ordered Gregore Sambor, the police commissioner in 1985, and William Richmond, the fire chief at that time, to pay $ 1 each week for the next 11 years, less than $ 1,800, to remind them of the incident.

"Preview of football game between Notre Dame and Ohio State at South Bend, Indiana (M) ","But Notre Dame's come-from-behind victory at Texas last week, coupled with losses by Nebraska and Tennessee, has suddenly revised the top of the polls and created more visible paths toward a spot in a national championship game. Never before had an Ohio State team exceeded 600 yards in consecutive games in the same season. Notre Dame Stadium is just a stadium you go in to play. The current Irish seniors were freshmen when they beat Florida State in the No. 1 versus No. 2 meeting that longtime Notre Dame observers considered the most intense in the history of the stadium. This game lacks the similar rankings and the weeks of buildup. The current freshman class was in fifth grade when Notre Dame won the 1988 national championship."

But his party may not win a majority, meaning that he would have to form a new coalition that could help set off a political realignment. These elections are regarded as particularly important because they will be the first under a new voting system that is expected to mean the extinction of some small parties and a reduction in the importance of conservative rural voters. A full 49 percent were undecided, and a surprising 8 percent said they would support a new party, the Democrats. Because it is so new, the Democratic Party is a wild card in the election, and it could emerge with the balance of power in a coalition."

Another law, passed this year, ends Empire's discounts for hospital fees. Stripped of its special mission and subsidies, Empire's management had to figure out how it would marshal enough resources to compete against well-financed commercial insurers. Management decided that Empire, like many nonprofit insurers across the country, would need to sell shares to profit-seeking investors. He will have to do even better if a for-profit Empire is to win the race against commercial insurers."

The country's leading labor unions called the strike to protest the economic policies that have brought fiscal stability to a nation once plagued by runaway inflation but have failed to address Argentina's record unemployment and deep recession. The unions are particularly upset over a recent Government proposal to overhaul decades-old labor laws.

Alcoa was the only major aluminum company to remain profitable when aluminum prices plummeted in late 1993, after the dissolving Soviet Union flooded world markets with aluminum. Despite depressed prices and inventories that are back up to about 962,000 tons, Alumax, Kaiser and many other aluminum producers have rushed their plants back into production. Alcoa remains vulnerable to aluminum prices, of course. But several analysts say that overseas demand for aluminum will drive prices up."

"Adam Clymer analysis contends that nobody outside House ethics committee knows just what committee meant when it questioned whether Speaker Newt Gingrich had provided its investigation 'accurate, reliable and complete information'; maintains that it is clear whatever lies or omissions committee suspects, they would amount to very serious offense--of sort that both House and Senate ethics committees have punished in past; photo (M) ","The committee added two new tax law questions on Thursday, and they may be simpler, although in discussion of tax law nothing is very simple.

Michael Epley letter discusses theory that meteor might have hit TWA Flight 800 (S) ,"To the Editor: Contrary to Guy Maxtone-Graham's Sept. 24 letter, the statistics-based theory that a meteor could have hit T.W.A. Flight 800 is not difficult to support. While it is true that tossing a coin 10 times leaves the odds of getting heads or tails on the 11th toss at 50- 50, this is not the proper way to look at the plane crash theory. The 11th coin toss ( like an aircraft's next takeoff ) is a future event dissociated from past events and their probabilistic outcomes. The demise of Flight 800 is a past occurrence that must be treated as a member of the family of past occurrences comprising manned flight, meaning all recorded takeoffs since Kitty Hawk."

Hence, while not the poorest Americans, elders are hardly all living on Easy Street. In addition, the phrase'' greedy geezers'' is an affront to dignity.

With a ViewThe Giants have practiced a lot the last few weeks in the stadium rather than on their grass practice field.

Week 10, in early November, is when teams lose any available salary-cap money for the season and the option to apply it toward next year. So if the Giants want to sign Strahan, an unrestricted free agent, to a large one-year deal to take advantage of that extra money, they would have to do so before Week 10. If they do n't, they would have to sign Strahan to a multiyear deal. Reeves said of Strahan.''"
