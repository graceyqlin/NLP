Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds mothers of newborns in New Jersey are staying in hospital 10 to 12 extra hours now that state law requires insurance companies to pay for longer stays (S) ,"Mothers of newborns in New Jersey are staying in the hospital 10 to 12 extra hours now that the state has a law requiring insurance companies to pay for longer stays, according to a study by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In June 1995, New Jersey joined 27 other states in requiring insurance companies to pay for two days in the hospital after a vaginal birth and four days after a Caesarean section if either the doctor or the mother requested it. Until then, they paid for only one day unless a longer stay was considered medically necessary. Additional studies will be done to determine whether the longer stay enables doctors to detect disorders and helps new mothers feel more confident about taking care of their babies, the C.D.C. said.

Paul R Huard letter replies to James H Smalhout's June 30 article on pension system (S) ,"According to the article, the problem is lack of portability in defined pension plans. The solution, it suggests, is requiring employers to index pension benefits to inflation when an employee leaves the company before retirement. The real problem is overregulation of retirement plans, making it difficult and costly for employers to offer these important benefits. The real solution is pension-simplification legislation that would eliminate the barriers now preventing many employers from offering comprehensive retirement plans.

Among the women on the show, the primary role model is Sally Ross. The show does sound some false notes."

Still the iguana is becoming fashionable. And for many youngsters, these prehistoric-looking animals are reminiscent of miniature dinosaurs. This summer, the iguanas, their nails cut to avoid scratching, could be seen perched on the heads or shoulders of their owners. When they were taken outside, usually when the weather was warm, many owners used harnesses. At 58th Street and Fifth Avenue, a woman known as the'' iguana lady'' ( left, center ) has been displaying her pets for years. Iguanas, native to Mexico and South America, often live high in trees, where their bluish-green or beige and brown colorings become camouflage. In captivity, they like to climb curtains.

People leasing cars must weigh their options carefully on whether to buy their cars at the end of the lease period or hand them back to the dealers; photos (M) ,"First of all, be careful not to confuse your car's worth with the residual value. You can buy the vehicle, paying the dealer the residual value, and either keep the car or resell it. Or you can just give the car back to the dealer. Keeping the car becomes attractive if its street price and residual value are about equal. That will reduce the residual value, making it cheaper for you to buy the car when the lease expires. Of course, you always have the option of walking away from the car, especially when the residual value is much higher than the street value, as is often the case. But if you really want to own your leased car, ask your dealer to offer you a more realistic price."

But scalpers' tendency to obtain the best seats leaves many true fans at a loss. The increase in ticket outlets and charge-by-phone lines makes it mathematically difficult to score the best tickets; availability changes constantly, and the first person to reach an outlet-- usually a scalper-- has a big advantage. Thus any ticketing conspiracy encouraged by any inside party can not be tolerated. BARRETT NEWMANWashington, Aug. 9The writer is box office manager at the Warner Theater."

Again, New York City will help the total national picture with a 12 percent decline in total reported crime for the first six months. It just so happens that the same rate in New York City for the same period decreased by 28 percent. He attributes the national crime drop to community policing, the Brady gun-control bill and a 1994 crime law designed to help communities hire 100,000 extra police officers. The crime rate dribbled down by 2 or 3 percent a year between 1991 and 1993-- enough to credit community policing with a victory."

Summer is now the harvest season-- a harvest of leisure, of fresh vegetables from the garden. Inevitably, one tries to ignore the signs of summer's demise-- the drying milkweed in the fields, the reddening sumac along the railroad tracks, the school buses. The days are still hot in Wyoming, the evenings warm, the skies full of dry thunder. it's true-- but summer will reign for at least a few more days. As the rumble of the train disappears, the crickets persist, and in their voices it is high summer all over again."
"Editorial, calling for campaign contribution reform, deplores role of big money at both Republican and Democratic National Conventions; notes Pres Clinton, while advocating reform, is most successful Presidential fund-raiser ever and has given big donors startling access to White House (M) ","Rivers of money flowed into the Republican and Democratic conventions from special interests, while donors were rewarded with skybox seats, parties, private meetings and other forms of access to policy makers. He advocates reform but also is the most successful Presidential fund-raiser in history, particularly for the'' soft money'' contributions to the Democratic Party, which are not governed by limits under campaign financing laws. But there are no limits on money contributed for broad party activities like getting out the vote and generally supporting state and local candidates. Taxpayer money pays each party $ 12 million to hold its convention, so that the parties will not raise the money elsewhere. But the parties set up host committees in the convention cities to do the job."
"Itamar Rabinovich resigns as Israel's Ambassador to United States, post he has held for four years, so that Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu can pick his own person to fill that important post; Rabinovich was ardent supporter of Israel's Labor Party Government in its attempts to find peace with Palestinians and Syria; Netanyahu chooses Eliahu Ben-Elissar to replace Rabinovich (M) ","As Israel's Ambassador to the United States for the last four years, Itamar Rabinovich faced up to American Jews who lobbied the American Government against Israel's attempt to find peace with the Palestinians and Syria. Those fault lines are nearly as dramatic among American Jews, the most passionate of whom, though not necessarily the majority, support Mr. Netanyahu's policies toward the Arabs.'' Some Jews, in their fierce opposition to the Labor Party's negotiated commitments to the Palestinians, went beyond public criticism to an active lobbying of the American Government against Israel's policies."

After the 1991 coup, the new military Government of Suchinda Kraprayoon became so brutal that it provoked a public backlash. The failure of that Government may have discredited violent political takeovers once and for all, several experts on Thailand said. It is not certain where he would take the Government, but his political philosophy appears to be well within the mainstream.''"
"Scores of militant nationalists seem set to assume political office in Serb-held Bosnia following elections scheduled for Sept 14; Western officials insist that balloting will be step toward stitching war-divided country back together, but critics say it will only affirm the existing ethnic partition; fiery campaign speeches by candidates seem to underscore that notion (M) ","But by most predictions, Mr. Aleksic and scores of militant nationalists like him seem set to assume political office in Serb-held Bosnia. Dealing with men like Mr. Aleksic, who is a candidate of the Serbian Radical Party, is unthinkable to many Muslims and unpalatable to most diplomats. The Serbian Radical Party is allied with the Serbian Democratic Party, which dominates Serb-controlled Bosnia. It has not fielded a presidential candidate, but has called on its supporters to vote for the nominee of the Serbian Democratic Party. This fierce hostility toward multi-ethnicity and the return of refugees will only be perpetuated.''To many ethnic Serbs, Mr. Aleksic is a war hero. The rules for next month's election bar people from running for office if they have been indicted on war crimes charges by the international tribunal in The Hague."

"Thomas L Friedman article on failure of new Israeli Prime Min Benjamin Netanyahu to advance Mideast peace effort in first 100 days in office; cites Netanyahu's preference for freezing relations with Palestinians and Syria where they are, scarcity of people around him he can trust and arrogance of his aide's in their belief that they can dictate to Palestinians (M) ","It was obvious during the campaign that Mr. Netanyahu was very adept at playing on Israelis' anxieties about the Labor-led peace process. That plan came a cropper when Israel's President, Ezer Weizman, said he would meet with Mr. Arafat to keep the peace process alive, if Mr. Netanyahu did n't. There are three core reasons for Mr. Netanyahu's dysfunctional first 100 days. It would be unfair to expect Mr. Netanyahu to carry out the Labor peace policies. The second reason is that Mr. Netanyahu has so few people around him whom he trusts. All this at a time when Israeli security officials say Mr. Arafat has been very effectively preserving the peace."

But with Rutgers trailing by 21- 7, the junior quarterback Ralph Sacca replaced Corey Valentine and sparked a 38-28 victory for the Scarlet Knights before 27,307 at Rutgers Stadium. It was a gratifying, if somewhat nail-biting debut for the new Rutgers coach, Terry Shea, who had pledged to turn the floundering football program into'' the pride of New Jersey.''"
Michael Chang defeats Vince Spadea in five sets at US Open; Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf are also among day's winners; list; photos (S) ,"From Vince Spadea's modest vantage point, the book on Michael Chang was a forbidding one: he never misses, he never surrenders and he never gives the Vince Spadeas of the world any room to breathe, particularly not when they're sharing his Grand Slam oxygen.

Kournikova broke Paulus at love to open the set and again to jump out to a 3- 0 lead. Then came the eighth game, the pivotal game of the match. But Paulus hit a forehand service return long and then put a backhand into the net. And it was four games all. The ninth game was also dramatic, with Paulus saving four break points. After four deuces, Paulus double-faulted to set up break point Paulus pelted a forehand long trying to return a whistling cross-court forehand."

Never had the best American professionals defeated the best Canadians in the four previous Canada Cup tournaments. Canada tied it at 1- 1 at 9:53 on the power play on a goal by Gretzky. After Lindros set up the play, Gretzky fired from a sharp angle and the puck may have hit United States defenseman Chris Chelios before getting by Richter. The United States scored the only two goals of the second period to take a 3- 2 lead into intermission.

My interest was academic until I researched my file for a February 1995 invoice from the same AAA Auto Diagnostic of Midtown ( for $ 2,776 ).

You did n't wear sneakers to school then but had to wear them in gym. No lockers were available so you carried your sneakers to school. Many boys would tie the laces together and place the sneakers around their necks. The pastime of grabbing these sneakers and playing'' monkey in the middle'' frequently resulted in the sneakers winding up dangling from the phone wires, or even draped over the schoolyard gates. On graduation day, many kids would toss the sneakers away ( like the West Point cadets tossing their hats ) and try to drape them over the wires."
Russian national security adviser Aleksandr I Lebed has reached peace accord with Chechen rebels that defers decision on status of secessionist republic; degree of Kremlin support for accord is unclear (S) ,"At least that's what Aleksandr I. Lebed, the self-confident Russian national security adviser, says. Yesterday he emerged from a meeting in southern Russia with Chechen rebel leaders and announced that the two sides had agreed to seek peace and to postpone until Dec. 31, 2001, a decision on the status of the secessionist, mostly Muslim republic. Even if a resolution of Chechnya's status is deferred, there is the thorny question of who will run the republic in the meantime. And the degree of Kremlin support for the new agreement was unclear; President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Lebed's boss, has repeatedly and uncompromisingly said Chechnya must remain a part of Russia."
Fugitive financier Robert L Vesco has been sentenced to 13 years in jail in Cuba in fraud involving unproven drug; move crushes hopes he will be returned to United States for trial on fraud and drug charges (S) ,"After a quarter century of intrigue that brushed the White House of Richard M. Nixon and then careered around Latin America and the Caribbean, the strange odyssey of Robert L. Vesco ended ignominiously last week in Cuba, the country that had offered him luxurious sanctuary for more than a decade. He was then sentenced to 13 years in jail-- perhaps a life sentence for a man who is now 60 and whose appearance at trial suggested frail health. Although the State Department rattled off its usual demand for his return, the sentence crushed whatever hopes remained that Mr. Vesco might someday stand trial in the United States, not only for fraud but also for trafficking drugs while in Cuba in the 1980's."

Pete Wilson of California said he was simply applying the law of the land when he ordered state agencies and colleges last week to stop doing anything that might help illegal immigrants. But in seeking some political benefit of his own from Washington's law, Mr. Wilson also ordered California's employees to verify the immigration status of the people they serve. In a state with some two million illegal immigrants and many more legal ones, it will be a task fraught with complications. Advocacy groups, which have already blocked the implementation of Proposition 187, a measure to cut off benefits to illegal immigrants, said they were confident they could stop the Governor in court-- at least until Attorney General Janet Reno issues rules on how the checking is to be done."
"Failure of effort by commercial expedition RMS Titanic Inc to raise piece of ship, which sank in 1912, reviewed; photo (S) ","The supposedly unsinkable Titanic has again proven itself to be eminently submersible. A commercial expedition to raise part of the luxury liner ended in failure in early morning darkness Friday when the nylon lines being used to lift a 21-ton section of the hull snapped and the chunk of steel, just 70 yards from the surface, dropped 2 1/2 miles back to the bottom of the cold North Atlantic. With food running low, the seas getting rough and the expedition members exhausted, the $ 5 million salvage operation, sponsored by RMS Titanic Inc., was abandoned until at least next summer. The Titanic sank on April 14, 1912, after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage from England to New York. More than 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew died. Its curse evidently continues."

On the contrary, it would foster healthy competition among all schools, improve education and reduce its escalating costs.

The latest change, which re-establishes the mean score at the center of the 200- 800 scale, was necessary to maintain the S.A.T.'s statistical integrity and predictive validity. Those features had been compromised as mean scores shifted below the midpoint on verbal and math, stretching out scores near the top and compressing scores toward the bottom.

Richard Phillips letter on Stephan-Gotz Richter's Aug 27 article on United States foreign aid to developing nations (S) ,"To the Editor: In'' How America Stiffs the Third World'' ( Op-Ed, Aug. 27 ), Stephan-Gotz Richter misses the point about United States foreign aid policy. The United States offers developing nations two benefits not as forthcoming from Japan, Germany or France. First, our market is more open to imports from developing nations than is that of any other industrialized nation. United States demand is the global economy's engine. This is most evident with respect to China, where no amount of aid will result in true benefit to us, but where our trade deficit nonetheless fosters development. Investment flows have a greater impact on development than does aid, since investment builds the framework for a self-sustaining future."
Morgan Murphy letter on Stephan-Gotz Richter's Aug 27 article on United States foreign aid to developing nations (S) ,"To the Editor: Stephan-Gotz Richter ( Op-Ed, Aug. 27 ) would have us believe that we live in a country of cheapskates and shortsighted politicians. I am not bothered that Japan and Germany give more aid to developing countries than the United States does. Neither Japan nor Germany has to substantially support its military; for 45 years the United States has done so. Richter sees our projected budget deficit of 1.9 percent of gross national product as impressive. Reducing our national debt, encouraging capitalism abroad, defending developing democracies with military might and being selective among those to whom we give foreign aid are not shortsighted goals."

"Alex Ross reviews Summergarden concert at Museum of Modern Art, featuring young pianist John Root; photo (S) ","Summergarden is almost certainly the best free music series to be found in New York. Rather than pander to a summer taste for mindless entertainment, Joel Sachs, the chairman of the music history department at the Juilliard School, invariably chooses a sprawling, ambitious concept around which to organize his annual concerts in the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. Paris: New Music 1896- 1996,'' was no exception. John Root, a young pianist who recently emerged from Juilliard, closed the 1996 series on Friday night with a stylish and adventurous Parisian program. Although Mr. Root's rhythmic accents were acute, his virtuosic bravura in this severe, experimental music sounded slightly out of place. MUSIC REVIEW"
Victor Davis Hanson Op-Ed article on disadvantages of family farmers like himself; warns that devaluation of physical labotr is weakening American society (S) ,"My family owns a farm, and last week we shipped a 28-pound box of Castleman plums to the East Coast. The real compensation that our society pays for life's essentials-- food and clothing-- is steadily eroding, and we are now beginning to pay the cultural and social costs. But our political leaders and economists reassure us that diminution in the value of labor is but an inevitable consequence of globalization, free trade and the rise of an information society. Congress, after much vitriolic debate, passed a slight raise in the minimum wage. Such societies, it is true, were remarkable for their organization of labor and capital. But their legacy is not, and has never been, consensual government, freedom and the literary and cultural achievements that accrue from egalitarian societies."

They do n't know what to make of it.''Raiding the New York chamber music scene for young but established players has become something of an unofficial policy at the Philharmonic in recent years.

The United States has never barred Iraqi military ground units from crossing the 36th parallel. But the Administration will argue that by taking Erbil, Mr. Hussein has violated United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, demanding that the Iraqi leader respect the human rights of all Iraqi citizens, the main underpinning for the zone. The hope here was that Iraqi forces would quickly withdraw, obviating the need for a dramatic American response. Indeed, there were unconfirmed reports of Iraqi attacks on areas around another stronghold of the 3.5 million Iraqi Kurds, the city of Sulaimaniya."

At both tables, West opened three diamonds and North overcalled three spades. This gave West an important negative inference in leading to six hearts. If East had held considerable club strength he would presumably have doubled six clubs. As a result both players, Geoff Pocock of Australia and Scott Smith of New Zealand, led the spade nine. Without it, South can eventually discard a spade on clubs. But you will search in vain for a brilliant way for South to avoid defeat after a spade lead. Sad to say, the New Zealand West player revoked. The club queen is then discarded when South leads the last trump."

Business Digest for Sept 2 ,"College Is Over; Let the Tests BeginWhen hiring white-collar employees, from top executives on down, a growing number of companies are no longer satisfied with traditional job interviews.

Others put prospective employees through a long series of interviews by psychologists or trained interviewers.

Quill and Betty Rollin ( Op-Ed, Aug. 29 ) would like to separate themselves from Dr. Jack Kevorkian while convincing us that Dr. Kevorkian's activities and the failure of juries to convict him point to the need to legalize physician-assisted suicide. The unwillingness of juries to convict Dr. Kevorkian is surely not an argument in favor of legalization of assisted suicide but is rather a reflection that the public is not aware that there are better alternatives to what Dr. Kevorkian is doing. The Dutch experience has made it evident that legal sanction of the practice of assisted suicide increases rather than curtails abuse of the practice. 1996The writer is executive director of the American Suicide Foundation, which is involved in suicide prevention."

But for years, the priority in New York City had been to create wider streets, to straighten them and to move traffic more quickly.

Some ecologists say that a further warming could consign some species to extinction by eliminating their habitats. Several recent studies have documented local population shifts, but these have been considered inconclusive because they were insufficient to show a range shift for the species as a whole: they could indicate merely a local expansion or contraction of a population. Moreover, other factors besides warming might explain the changes; local populations of wild species might be eliminated by local air pollution or changes in land use, for instance. So the evidence on altitude shifts caused by climatic change'' is n't as clean'' as that for a shift in range, she said."

Swinney's laboratory worked with brass balls about the size of sand grains, distributed in a layer some 13 balls thick across the floor of a cylindrical tray. Brass balls were used instead of sand because they are more uniform in size than sand grains. At certain frequencies and amplitudes, surprising patterns form among the churning brass balls.

While leasing new space will increase short-run capacity, the board's leasing policies are inadequate. The board reacts instead of planning its leasing requirements. Many overcrowded schools house administrative offices that can be converted to thousands of seats. Some programs, like special education, use exorbitant school space. Overcrowding requires immediate action. FRANCISCO RIVERA- BATIZNew York, Aug. 30,"
Rowland J Hwang letter disputes Peter Passell's Aug 29 Economic Scene column on myths surrounding electric cars vs. new gasoline-powered vehicles (S) ,"To the Editor: It is paradoxical that despite Peter Passell's attempt to dispel so-called'' politically correct'' myths about electric vehicles ( Economic Scene, Aug. 29 ), he continues to perpetuate a myth about gas-powered cars. Passell contends that new gasoline vehicles are 95 to 98 percent cleaner than before emission standards were put in place. Although the standards for tailpipe emissions have been lowered to this amount, actual emissions are 600 times greater. Cars and trucks are responsible for more than half the smog-forming emissions in urban areas. That is why states are calling for automakers to do their part to clean the air by building clean electric cars. 1996The writer is a senior analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists."
"Walter Goodman reviews The People and The Power Game, written and created by Hedrick Smith, host; show is part of PBS Democracy Project; photo of Smith (M) ","The People and the Power Game'' uses case histories to good effect to bring home why they have become so troubling in recent years. Taking on the press, that old newspaperman Hedrick Smith focuses on the Gennifer Flowers episode to demonstrate how an account of President Clinton's extracurricular affinities made it from a supermarket tabloid to the most respectable network news programs. The tobacco story proves particularly pungent as Mr. Smith discloses how professionals compose and orchestrate seemingly grass roots appeals to Congress. Next week, Mr. Smith provides a knowing look into recent battles in the Democratic Party and between the Clinton White House and the Gingrich Congress. It makes for meaty election-season watching.

New York Jets discuss 31-6 loss to Denver Broncos (M) ,"They played against the Broncos without their starting offensive tackles, Jumbo Elliott ( pulled groin muscle ) and David Williams ( back spasms ). And then during the game, they lost the left side of their defensive line. Erik Howard, the left tackle, suffered ligament damage in his right knee and his season appears over. So the Jets may have to stay with their makeshift front of Boatswain ( normally a right tackle ) at left tackle, Harry Galbreath ( normally a right guard ) at left guard, Dave Alexander ( returning from reconstructive knee surgery ) at center, Matt O'Dwyer ( a raw second-year pro ) at right guard and Roger Duffy ( normally the left guard ) at right tackle.

Michiko Kakutani reviews Joan Didion's latest novel The Last Thing He Wanted; photo (M) ,"How do the dots connect in Elena's life, or do they connect at all?This is the story that Ms. Didion has set out to tell in'' Perhaps because Ms. Didion has already defined this sort of character so authoritatively, Elena often comes across as a cartoon version of her earlier heroines. Didion slowly and deliberately deals out the cards of Elena's life, and as we arrange them, a picture begins to emerge, a picture of a woman who has spent the better part of her life trying to reinvent herself. With each of her novels, Ms. Didion has moved further and further from the realm of the personal toward that murky realm where the private and the political intersect."

Editorial warns that abortion opponents in state legislatures around country are winning stealth war to limit women's constitutional right to choose; says right to choose requires extra vigilance (M) ,"In many states, access to abortion is now prohibitively daunting for all but a small percentage of women. In many states, women must drive four or five hours to the nearest clinic. Hospital abortion is now so expensive that women must go to doctors' offices or specialized abortion clinics. Linking these is a spate of new state laws that provide the final blow to any doctor still interested in performing abortions and block a woman's journey to a big-city clinic. Eleven states require women to get counseling by a doctor and then either stay overnight or make another trip to have the abortion later, usually 24 hours later. They have later, more dangerous abortions in states with such laws. Thirty-seven states deny Medicaid coverage for abortions even when necessary to preserve the woman's health."
"Editorial urges US Senate to ratify Chemical Weapons Convention, negotiated during Reagan and Bush Administrations and signed by US and 129 other nations (M) ","America's military leaders, an impressive array of Democrats and Republicans and the Chemical Manufacturers' Association have all endorsed the convention. The agreement would ban development, manufacture, stockpiling and sales of chemical weapons. Most countries accept the Geneva Convention of 1925 that prohibits them from initiating the use of chemical weapons in combat. This is hard to enforce, however, without a rigorous inspection system or restrictions on chemical weapons manufacture and stockpiling. The new convention would make it harder for rogue countries or terrorists to get the ingredients for chemical weapons, some of which also have commercial uses. Current military doctrine calls for answering any military use of chemical weapons with overwhelming conventional force. Putting the treaty into force would strengthen the world's defenses against chemical attacks, both military and terrorist."

Would Chechen rebels, having bested Russian troops in the recent fighting in Grozny, delay their drive for independence? And would hard-line Russian officials, bitter about their humiliation on the battlefield, resist the temptation to strike back?Underscoring the problems, Mr. Chernomyrdin complained today that Chechen rebels were persecuting pro-Moscow officials."

This time the Giants lost because in the second half they went three-downs-and-out on six consecutive series. In the first half, the Giants ran the ball both on first and second down just once in five possessions. But something changed in the second half. The Giants played mostly'' cover one,'' meaning they blitzed and had their cornerbacks play man to man.

There are strong seasonal variations in vitamin D levels, especially in northern states."

If the condition is detected early, treatment can prevent significant bone loss and fractures. Since women usually start out with thinner bones than men, this loss puts them at great risk of fractures as they age. Men do not experience a sudden dramatic decline in bone mass, but their more gradual losses add up. The older a man is, the greater his bone loss is likely to be. Men with blood relatives who have developed osteoporosis and had osteoporotic fractures are at greater risk than those with relatives who aged without significant signs of bone loss."

"Russian national security adviser Aleksandr I Lebed, in grimmest assessment to date of death toll in war in breakaway province of Chechnya, says at least 80,000 people have been killed and some 240,000 wounded; estimates far exceed many casualty projections, that 30,000 to 40,000 people died in 21 months of conflict; photo (S) ","Lebed's assessment came during a news conference in which he defended the recent accord that ended the fighting and deferred the question of Chechnya's independence. Since Mr. Lebed signed an accord with Chechen military commanders, his task has been further complicated by Kremlin infighting. Mr. Lebed has been chided by Kremlin rivals, who have complained that the accord makes too many concessions to Chechen rebels. So, Mr. Lebed has taken his case to the public to maintain a sense of momemtum for the peace plan. But today Mr. Chernomyrdin gave grudging, if qualified, support for the agreement in a meeting with regional leaders from the north Caucasus.''The agreements signed by Lebed cause some concern, but on the whole we consider them right,''"
"As 51 million students return to their classrooms this fall, American education is being reshaped by politically volatile programs allowing parents to choose their children's schools and sometimes even to create them; initiatives include voucher plans in Milwaukee and Cleveland where parents get public money to pay for private schools, charter schools in 25 states which allow schools to be run independently of district regulations and urban and suburban magnet schools, with enticing courses of study that now attract 1.2 million students (M) ","Still, the public appears less and less resistant to that form of school choice. The 269 charter schools enrolling 70,000 students last year figure to grow to at least 350 this year, with many more sure to follow. The publicly financed charter schools, which usually have a well-defined educational philosophy, can be started by parents, teachers, private companies or other groups in existing or new buildings. If you take race out of the old neighborhood-school argument, you come down to the strongest thing weighing against school choice. Essentially, school choice is the end of the neighborhood school. ' Choice is basically peripheral; it does n't get to the heart of what makes schools better. Proponents say school choice will create new models of excellence that will enrich existing schools."

Most oil industry analysts were cautious about making firm predictions. The stocks of several large oil companies also jumped. Instead, the price of crude oil rose as Iraq failed to reach an agreement and refiners then pushed through higher prices for gasoline, which was under strong demand."
"Analysis; American military attack against Iraq has embroiled US in internal Iraqi politics, essentially forcing it to take sides in decades-old dispute between two rival Kurdish factions; while Pres Clinton is fighting war against Pres Saddam Hussein that predecessor George Bush never finished, it is difficult to discern concrete American goals in its military operation, or what would constitute acceptable change in Hussein's behavior (M) ","After Mr. Bush decided to end the American-led war against Iraq in 1991 without overthrowing the Iraqi leader or destroying his military, the United States was left with limited and messy options. But, like it or not, the American military attack has embroiled the United States in internal Iraqi politics, essentially forcing it to take sides in a decades-old dispute between two rival Kurdish factions. When the United States uncovered what it said was an Iraqi plot to assassinate Mr. Bush, Mr. Clinton ordered the bombing of an Iraqi military intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in 1993.

The upgrade indicated that investors were far less likely to be shaken by the new outbreak of insurgent violence than they were in January 1994, when the Zapatista rebels staged an uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, causing Mexico's markets to plunge. A new group calling itself the Popular Revolutionary Army carried out attacks in six states on Aug. 28.The IPC index, the Mexican stock market's main gauge, closed sharply down on Aug. 29, then steadied."

"As investigators examine tortured family history of Nadine Lockwood, child welfare experts say her death appears to conform to a pattern seen in extreme cases of abuse: one child is singled out among several siblings as focus of abusive parent's irrational rage (M) ","As investigators examined the tortured family history of Nadine Lockwood yesterday, child welfare experts said her death appeared to conform to a pattern seen in extreme cases of abuse: one child is singled out among several siblings as the focus of an abusive parent's irrational rage. The abuse in that case also appeared to stem from the mother's psychological associations between the abused child and her absent father, since Marisol had a different father than her four siblings, who were spared much of the abuse. Whether the recent New York City cases involved one child or every sibling, they reflect broader economic and social patterns that contribute to child abuse, experts in the field say."
"Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column says US cruise missile attack against Iraq for military action against Kurds underscores fact that half-finished Gulf war, half-finished Arab Israeli peace process and half-baked US containment policies of both Iraq and Iran have failed to produce new order in Middle East; says they have, instead, contributed to regional disorder, in which Washington lacks united front to support its strategies or many partners to help manage its contradictions (M) ","You could n't possibly see or hear the U.S. cruise missiles smashing into Iraq from here in downtown Teheran, but you sure could feel the political fallout raining down on the region. Indeed, these latest bombings of Iraq did much more to reveal the mess in the Middle East than to resolve it. On the one hand the U.S. wants Saddam out of power. What those bombings also revealed, though, was just how chaotic the situation with the Kurds had become in the U.S-created power vacuum in northern Iraq. The bottom line: The half-finished gulf war and the half-finished Arab-Israeli peace process and the half-baked U.S. containment policies of both Iran and Iraq-- containments that are rhetorically all-out war, but operationally something far less-- have failed to produce a new order in the Middle East."

In this instance, however, Ms. Lockwood never even tried to take her child home. In December, that caseworker was removed from child welfare casework."

The auto workers' union has excellent relations with Ford, and Ford executives have a history of devising innovative solutions to intractable labor disputes. Ford already buys much more than half its parts from outside suppliers and needs few concessions from the union on this issue.

Chrysler officials also said they looked forward to further negotiations.

"Editorial says American cruise-missile attacks on military targets in southern Iraq are reasonable and proportionate response to Pres Saddam Hussein's latest act of aggression, and that Pres Clinton has handled situation with acceptable blend of American power and restraint (M) ","Saddam Hussein's talent for mismanaging Iraq is matched by an uncanny ability to misread the United States. The American cruise-missile attacks on military targets in southern Iraq yesterday were a reasonable, proportionate response to Mr. Hussein's latest act of aggression, this one directed against thousands of his own countrymen. They minimized the danger to American forces and to Iraqi civilians, while making it safer for American planes to enforce a newly expanded no-flight zone in southern Iraq intended to humiliate Mr. Hussein. Striking southern Iraq will not directly impede Iraqi forces in the north, but bombing them would have risked numerous civilian casualties. Clinton acted properly under a 1991 U.N. Security Council resolution that bars Iraq from abusing its Kurdish citizens."

Warfield said Mr. Dole had not intended to signal to Mr. Clinton any concern that his previous public statements on the subject might have given offense.'' Dole's policy and political history on Iraq is a convoluted one. In April 1990, four months before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Dole met with Mr. Hussein."
