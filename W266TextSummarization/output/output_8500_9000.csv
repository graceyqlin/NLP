Edward R Lipinski column offers advice on repairing roof; drawing (M) ,"Press the shingle onto the cement layer then smooth more cement over the crack. Instead, raise the shingle and cover the exposed area with roofing cement. Cover the nail heads with more roofing cement. Some shingles may be curled up away from the roof. Apply a generous dab of roofing cement under the shingle, then press it onto the cement. Before you can position the replacement, you'll have to remove the torn shingle and also the roofing nails that secure it. Secure it with roofing nails. Finish the job by dabbing roofing cement under the new shingle. Not all roofs are protected with asphalt shingles. Press the shingle down and secure it with two nails. Cover the crack and nail heads with roofing cement."
Joan Lee Faust column offers advice on growing tulips and other flowers in garden in early fall; drawing (M) ,"The big three in the bulb world are synonymous with spring. Another diminutive bulb flower that may be one of the first to bloom is the tiny winter aconite ( Eranthis hyemalis ). The bulb should be planted where it can multiply by seeding itself over the years. The flowers are basically white with a blue stripe. Since the wind flower foliage dies down readily it does not get in the way of later bloom. These leaves die down and new ones and spikes of blue bloom appear in the spring. If the bulbs can be planted where the thick foliage does no harm, the blooms are well worth the effort. The lists of popular bulb flowers can go on and on."
Christine Stevens letter on July 7 article on New York University's dismissal of Dr Jan Moor-Janowski after he complained about inhumane animal research at another NYU facility (S) ,"The case of Dr. Jan Moor-Janowski and New York University $ ('' In the Maelstrom of Animal Medical Studies,'' July 7 $ ) is an extraordinary example of almost inexplicable treatment of a distinguished scientist by an equally distinguished academic institution. It all began when Dr. Moor-Janowski, whose dedication to the highest standards of research probity is unquestioned, protested what he deemed inhumane experiments at another N.Y.U. facility. Although the Lemsip chimpanzees could have been transferred to another research institution, N.Y.U. directed that they go to Fred Coulston, a toxicologist who has publicly averred his dislike of chimps and who has opposed their retirement."

"Delta Air Lines plans new division, Delta Express, to offer lower-fare service between Florida and Northern and Midwestern cities (S) ","Delta Air Lines plans to start a new low-fare division called Delta Express next month to offer low-fare service linking 10 cities in the Northeast and Midwest with five cities in Florida. Delta Express will sell 7-day and 21-day advance purchase tickets, as well as walk-up fares. Passengers will earn the same Delta frequent flier mileage on Delta Express. The move by Delta is largely in response to the expansion of low-fare carriers like Southwest Airlines, which recently started offering service to and within Florida, an important market for Delta, and is the latest attempt by a major airline to set up a smaller division modeled after Southwest. United Airlines, for example, operates the United Shuttle among many Western cities. Continental Airlines tried and failed in recent years with its Continental Lite operation."

"State Department lifts warning against travel to Guatemala, but still cautions Americans about possibility of violence (S) ","The State Department has lifted its two-year-long warning against travel to Guatemala, but is still cautioning Americans about the possibility of violence. Americans are frequent victims of pickpockets and robbers on public buses, and in tourist sites in cities. A few years ago, rumors that foreigners were involved in the kidnapping of Guatemalan children for the purpose of using their organs for transplant resulted in mob violence in several parts of the country. Although the last incident of this sort was in 1994 and the threat of further occurrences is not considered'' immediate,'' the State Department encourages Americans to avoid contact with Guatemalan children. It is suggested that anyone adopting a Guatemalan child travel with that child as little as possible. For recorded travel information, call ( 202 ) 647- 5225."

F W Kelly letter notes that many of Ireland's fine horses are descended from cavalry horses left behind in Oliver Cromwell's failed invasion ,"At the conclusion there is some emphasis on the difference between Irish and American horses. While the'' invasion'' failed, the cavalry horses that Cromwell left behind originated the lines of many of today's fine Irish horses. The Cromwell horses were only two or three generations from their ancestors, who carried armored men on long campaigns into battle. This required the strength, power and endurance of a draft horse. In a picture with the article, fetlocks on the horse shown clearing a bank are evidence of draft horse background. In fact, it is simply another family characteristic of the draft horse."

I telephoned the French Government Tourist Office in New York to request a Paris street map and a Metro map. The number in the Manhattan telephone directory had been disconnected. The information operator gave a 900 number to call, which I did. The person who answered promised to send me the maps and asked me a lot of questions.

The show may have been a commercial success, but your writer, Glenn Collins, failed to mention the long lines and waiting time of up to an hour. The comfort of the art patron was not considered in this event. Lines snaked around to enter the first room. Inside, viewers were four and five deep. The museum could have planned things better to accommodate those who came from far away, perhaps never to attend another show of this kind ( at least not in Philadelphia).SEYMOUR B.

On a recent trip from Minneapolis to Ardmore, Pa., I found that the Empire Builder, Capitol Limited and Three Rivers trains were actually quite smoky in certain places. The observation car on the first two trains contained two designated smoking sections, partitioned only by narrow plexiglass strips on either side of the aisle that allowed plenty of smoke to circulate throughout the nonsmoking section sandwiched between them. The Three Rivers train had no observation car, so the cafe car contained the smoking section, which had no partitions to divide it from the nonsmoking section. BARBARA BROWNEGladwyne, Pa."

Just because the author happens to disagree with that statement, which I believe holds a lot of truth, does not give him leave to offend a great many people, including non-Calvinists. Otherwise, the article was an interesting depiction of a favorite area of mine.

Suggestions for one-day visit to Geneva (S) ,"Leave the blue-green lake, Geneva's glory, for the early afternoon when the autumn light is best, and start your sightseeing day in the Old Town.

Suggestions for one-day visit to Amsterdam (S) ,"Here is the great Renaissance town hall, proof of the wealth of the 17th-century merchants ( it later became a royal palace ), and next door are the Gothic arches of the 15th-century New Church. Another enticing, half-hidden place is the Amsterdam Historical Museum. A small, lopsided gateway on the Kalverstreet leads into the cluster of 17th-century buildings, once the city orphanage. It has an impressive display of documents and objects covering seven centuries, but I'm rather partial to its play-it-yourself carillon and the surprising outdoor ( though glassed-in ) art gallery with its images from the prosperous, bourgeois past: aligned here are large group portraits of the Civic Guards and the guilds, part of that popular painting tradition from which Rembrandt's'' Night Watch'' also sprang."
"Andy Newman reviews Jaimito's Restaurant, Clifton, NJ; photo (M) ","Even the potatoes. The potato is the national staple of Peru and it shows up in the mostly unlikely places at Jaimito's-- as french fries atop the rice in a stir-fried chicken dish, lomo saltado; as cold potatoes benedict in the cadmium-yellow appetizer papa a la huancaina. The spaghetti with pesto is garnished with a single, large roasted potato. Some dishes are simple and delicious, like tacu-tacu, a soul-satisfying plate of white beans and rice, or Mr. Lam's version of fried rice ( Peru has a large Chinese population, and Chinese restaurants, called chifas, are as common there as they are here )."
"Recent Federal court decision that opened New Jersey's trash market to competition is taking its toll on county agencies that handle garbage; on Sept 18, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded bonds of Union County Utilities Authority and Camden County Pollution Control Financing Authority to BB, from A- and BBB+ respectively (S) ","The recent Federal court decision that opened New Jersey's trash market to competition is taking its toll on the county agencies that handle garbage. On Wednesday, Standard & amp; Poor's downgraded the bonds of the Union County Utilities Authority and the Camden County Pollution Control Financing Authority to BB, from A- and BBB+ respectively. The July court ruling that the state could no longer force towns to take garbage to the county dump hit Camden and Union counties particularly hard, said Mark W. Glotfelty, Standard & amp; Poor's associate director of public finance ratings. Like other counties, Camden and Union had been counting on state-guaranteed dumping fees to help pay off bonds for state-mandated incinerators.

Hurricanes and tropical storms this month prompted some beach officials to bring back lifeguards, who traditionally leave after Labor Day.

At other times, when the weather was nice but the surf rough, the police were asked to pay extra attention to the beach area.

Doctors' offices were inundated, supermarkets packed, services strained. One can not blame people for relocating here or developers for taking advantage of a lucrative situation.

Accessories recall the giddy days of Carnaby Street in the late 60's, with high- and spread-collared shirts and silk Jacquard ties-- both in brightly colored solids and stripes-- complementing these dark-toned suits.

A simple way to guarantee justice to lower-income jurisdictions would be requiring that toxic waste sites in a state are in a variety of communities whose average per capita income is at or above the state income average. For example, because toxic waste sites are now situated almost exclusively in communities below the mean income level, all new sites would by law need to be put in jurisdictions above the state average income until distribution is equitable. 1996The writer is director of research for the Horizon Institute for Policy Solutions, a public-policy group."

Discussion at September 24 meeting of Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is expected to be more heated than usual owing to recent public comments by Fed members and the reported request by 8 of the 12 regional bank presidents for a hike in the discount rate (M) ,"That sentiment would be bad for long-term interest rates, which are sensitive to inflation fears. The combination of no action on Tuesday and a strong employment report for September could fuel pressure for a one-half point increase in the Fed funds rate in November. Forecasters would probably say that the Fed needs to be tougher, having passed up a rate increase on Tuesday. If the Fed does act, long-term rates should rise but short-term rates could fall because they have already risen in anticipation of an increase. But even if the rate climbs, analysts will begin speculating on when the Fed might move again, based both on the size of the increase and on their own economic projections. If this is the case, the Fed might have to move more strongly on raising interest rates."

The rest are part of chains. Large chains, with their economies of scale, move in, to the detriment of mom-and-pop shops. The reasons are demographics, said Phillip Schneider, a spokesman for the National Association for Chain Drug Stores. He cited an aging population that needs more prescription drugs, customers who tend to self-medicate and busy two-career couples who want the longer hours of the chains. One morning soon after Rite Aid opened, a steady stream of customers filed into Suba. Suba said it was too early to gauge Rite Aid's impact but was happy to hear many customers promise to keep patronizing him."

Agnew, who to me represented the worst element in American politics. Forget for the moment his criminal offenses and eventual anti-Semitism as reported by Mr. Safire. If we focus on his performance in public life before his downfall as Vice President, Mr. Agnew was a man who brought nothing positive to government. The theme of these speeches was unvaryingly negative; they preached hate and resentment, and pitted Americans against Americans.

Word for Word column quotes from directives issued by health maintenance organizations to curb doctors' disclosure of costly treatment information to patients(S) ,"Another describes the H.M.O. as'' your health partner for life.'' Here are examples of H.M.O-physician contracts, obtained from H.M.O.'s, doctors, consumer groups and members of Congress working on health care legislation. This clause, found in the contract of Choice Care in Cincinnati, would seem to limit what a physician can say about his patients' health care plan. The health care market is intensely competitive, and H.M.O.'s are competing with one another to attract patients. Doctors may be affiliated with several health plans. Such fierce competition fuels the fears of H.M.O.'s that doctors may take patients with them to another health plan where the doctor has a more lucrative contract."

"Comment on suggestions that US give up hard line on Iran and return to old-fashioned balance-of-power diplomacy; commentators point out that Iran has not developed into expansionist regional threat and, with its vast population and oil reserves, still holds central position in Persian Gulf; photo of Iranian family at picnic (S) ","Iran, after all, has been the Bermuda Triangle of American foreign policy ever since the ayatollahs overthrew the monarchy 17 years ago, and its officials have not signaled any serious desire to deal with Washington. , Iran has not developed into the expansionist regional threat that successive Administrations predicted it would become. The policy also seeks to thwart Iran's efforts, with its neighbors, to develop the vast oil and gas resources in the Caspian Sea, by barring American companies from a role in any consortium that includes Iran. So it stuck with a vague but more flexible policy of promising that good will from Iran would be reciprocated."

It took two centuries, until 1990, for the median age to rise to 33. By some estimates, American baby boomers on average are setting aside only a bit more than one-third what they need for retirement. Already, the retirement age to receive social security benefits has been raised in the United States, and more increases are likely. Indeed, some of the countries that are aging most rapidly are in the statistically younger third world. The reason for aging there has less to do with baby boomers, and more to do with two other demographic factors. But in Japan today 57 percent of people over the age of 65 still live with their children."
"Comment links new regard for Catholic schools to failing state of urban public school systems; links success of parochial schools to high standards set for all students, interaction between students and teachers, and crucially, commitment of parents who value education and get involved with schools; photo (S) ","So what is the magic of parochial schools? And, why ca n't the public schools replicate it?No ( In most Catholic schools only about 10 percent of the teachers are nuns.)It is certainly not the resources. Catholic schools are generally low-budget operations, with smaller expenditures per pupil than the public schools. Catholic schools still require those, and there are some people who think they engender the right attitude. Since Catholic schools are smaller, with minimal bureaucracy, there is more interaction between students and teachers. Catholic schools, some say, are working because they endorse certain values.'' But the Catholic schools were highly motivational. At the Catholic schools, that is not the case. These requirements would hold even for the public school students who transfer to parochial schools."

In contrast to how he lived, Mr. Shakur was given a quiet funeral in a small, private ceremony. His bullet-riddled body was quickly cremated, leaving his millions of fans no last chance to see the face that had frequently peered out from popular magazines, CD covers, music videos and movies like'' Juice'' and'' A man who called The New York Times without identifying himself asked,'' What does Tupac spell backwards?''"
"Editorial Notebook comment suggests that murder of rapper Tupac Shakur may be one more blow to violent, culturally poisonous genre ","When he was gunned down in Las Vegas, the rap star Tupac Shakur was under contract to Death Row Records, the West Coast juggernaut that pioneered gangster rap, a wildly successful music made up of misogyny, hypermaterialism and open celebration of murder. Nurtured by the entertainment giant Time Warner, the company has earned more than $ 100 million, primarily on gangster rap. Knight is the architect of a feud between Death Row in the West and its East Coast rival, Bad Boy Entertainment. But he was the second Death Row insider to be murdered in the last year.

Editorial urges Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates now ,"The Federal Reserve is coming under enormous pressure, from inside and out, to raise interest rates when it meets Tuesday. Many on Wall Street, and most of the presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks, are pushing for a rate hike as a preventive strike against inflation. The feared impact of a Fed hike of short-term rates-- the only ones it controls-- on mortgage and other important long-term rates is also misplaced. A Fed decision to raise short-term rates would signal Wall Street that it intends to bring inflation lower. An expectation of lower inflation could bring long-term rates-- a portion of which compensates lenders for future inflation-- down. The Fed would be not be acting irresponsibly if it raised rates on Tuesday. A rate hike might not even be wrong."
"Editorial warns North Korea's opaque leadership that continued provocations, like submarine incursion in South Korea, will quickly undermine American political support for diplomatic engagement ","North Korea, secretive and belligerent, persists in menacing its South Korean neighbor and mystifying the rest of the world. But those attempts have now been complicated by reports that some American prisoners of war captured during the Korean War may not have been returned as promised after the 1953 armistice and by a reckless and provocative North Korean attempt to infiltrate armed commandos into South Korea by submarine. While North Korea was legally responsible for fulfilling the armistice terms, many Americans were actually held by Chinese, Russian and East European military and medical units operating in North Korea. Armed infiltrations from the North are disturbingly common in South Korea, but few recent ones have been this spectacular. Washington's policy of cautious engagement with North Korea is designed to defuse the threat of military conflict over the longer term."

The only thing odd about all this is that the crime rate has been falling in Tampa, as it has in many other cities around the country. Beyond Wichita, she said of crime,'' But in the same poll, almost two-thirds of the people surveyed said the crime problem in their own neighborhood was either improving or staying the same. Dole turned to the crime issue in part out of a confidence that the rate at which people are actually victimized might be of less political importance than their fears.''"

"Teachers' unions, which have resisted movement to create charter schools out of concern about teachers' benefits, are changing their views; as 25 states have passed legislation to allow schools that are publicly financed yet independently run, National Education Assn is encouraging its chapters to start their own such schools; on smaller scale, American Federation of Teachers is making similar efforts (M) ","The first N.E.A-sponsored school opened this month in Lanikai, Hawaii. If the classes were incorporated into a charter school, she said, the teachers would like to extend the school day by two hours, an hour on either side. The statewide union in Connecticut hopes to choose its N.E.A. school before Dec. 2, the state's deadline for charter school applications. The American Federation of Teachers, with 900,000 members, has also been helping chapters begin charter schools.

Joseph Gerson letter objects to unilateral US military action against Iraq ,"In fact, since 1944 when the United States replaced Britain as the hegemonic power in the Middle East, Washington has used'' any means necessary'' ( in the words of the Carter Doctrine ) to insure ultimate control over Middle East oil. Not incidentally, control of Middle East oil has provided the United States with influence over the economies and politics of Japan and our European allies, among others. Friedman correctly describes the paucity of Washington's vision for the Middle East. Neither cruise missiles nor military action will bring peace or justice to Iraq or the Middle East. The United States should be working through the United Nations and other diplomatic forums to address the dangers inherent in Saddam Hussein's brutal rule and to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."

Helping to insure Europe's and Japan's reliance on the region for 30 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of their oil may be of equal or greater importance to the success of my ( and thousands of others' ) individual investments and of other global investments than simply protecting America's 10 percent reliance on gulf oil."

When each route system was complete, a long-term operating lease with a private company would be negotiated.

I suspect that having a low Bacon number means one is wealthy and famous, but I'd still rather have a low Erdos number."
Letter from Stan Pottinger comments on Anne Riophe's Sept 19 Op-Ed article on late-term abortions (S) ,"To the Editor: The only thing wrong with Anne Roiphe's moral angst over late-term abortions ( Op-Ed, Sept. 19 ) is that she blames women's choice advocates for the revulsion many people feel about the procedure. While there may be a handful of advocates who feel no paradox about the procedure-- just as a number of abortion opponents express no moral doubt about sacrificing a woman's life to save a doomed fetus-- there are too few advocates with this degree of emotional insulation to fairly characterize their side of the debate. Advocates who are fighting for the right of women to save themselves are generally as sensitive to this human plight as Ms. Roiphe says they should be. Lecturing them to appreciate the complexities of this drama is unnecessary. STAN POTTINGERSouth Salem, N.Y., Sept. 20, 1996"
"Op-Ed column by Bob Herbert describes chaotic scene outside New York City's Emergency Assistance Unit in Bronx, where women and their young children waited in rain to find some shelter and eventually, they hoped, a subsidized apartment; says number of homeless children in New York City is growing and employment is the essential issue; holds there is economic depression in inner cities, but no one is paying much attention (M) ","Timothy was with his mother, Kim Dixon, his brother, Byron, 10, and his sister, Keisha, 8, in a downpour outside the city's Emergency Assistance Unit, a chaotic place in the Bronx where homeless families go to seek shelter and eventually, they hope, a subsidized apartment. Quietly, disastrously, the number of homeless children in New York City is growing. These are very, very poor families and their kids suffer terribly from being homeless. The second problem is that entry-level work does not pay enough to cover Harlem, South Bronx or Bed-Stuy rents for a family of four or five. The families exist on the edge."
New York Rangers notes; Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier join team for preseason game in Las Vegas (M) ,"But the biggest roar Wayne Gretzky received was when the scoreboard flashed a video of Gretzky doing an Elvis Presley parody years ago when he hosted'' The king of hockey played his first game as a Ranger on Saturday night, and it was similar to his performance as an entertainer: a little stiff.

In the third period, Niklas Sundstrom played a couple of shifts on Gretzky's line instead of Kovalev. Messier centered Luc Robitaille and Peter Ferraro, who scored the Rangers' first goal."
Jack Anderson reviews third program offered by Rambert Dance Company at Joyce Theater; photo (M) ,"The Rambert Dance Company rejoiced and lamented on Friday night, when it offered the third program of its engagement at the Joyce Theater.

Alan Truscott Bridge column; diagram (M) ,"Players and administrators are normally in two different worlds, and to play on an international level while fully occupied in bridge administration is a great rarity. A minor-suit lead was indicated, but the choice was unclear. An ace lead would have made South's task easy, but Mrs. Fleming guessed to lead a low diamond. South would have made 10 tricks routinely by leading a minor suit, but she blundered by leading the heart ten and ducking in dummy. When East led the club queen, South played low and West overtook with the ace, deliberately establishing South's king. She then led another low diamond and South naturally misguessed by playing the nine. The defense took two diamond tricks, together with a club trick and a heart trick, and defeated the game. Bridge"
US defeats Europe to win Solheim Cup golf championship (M) ,"Instead of more huge cheers reverberating across the rolling Old Course at St. Pierre Country Club on the final day of the Solheim Cup, there was often only the sound of the wind whistling past the medieval stone church and rustling through the chestnuts and oaks.''Silence is indeed golden when you are playing over here,'' said Betsy King, an American team member. When Robbins and Nicholas, the day's seventh pairing, approached the 18th, Robbins needed only to win the hole to halve the match and secure the cup. But on the 18th, after Nicholas missed her short birdie putt and Robbins made hers, the only roar at St. Pierre came from the American players, Solheim Cup champions for the third and certainly not the last time."

Anna Kisselgoff reviews program Indrani: Dancers and Musicians of India at Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College; photo (M) ,"Dance in India has sacred roots, but by the 19th century a once-vital art form had fallen into disrepute. Among those who played a role in the rebirth of classical dance in India in the 1920's and 30's was the dancer Ragini Devi. Indrani, her daughter, has continued this tradition through her own performing and teaching and by familiarizing Western audiences with the distinct classical schools of Indian dance. Three of India's major classical styles were on view: Orissi from the east, Kathak from the north and Bharata Natyam from the south. All three dances began with invocations to Hindu deities. Her dance in honor of Shiva was expressly poetic. Rasana Devi had an unexpected stiffness in the whirling, stamping Kathak dances, but her flamenco-like footwork was precise and nuanced."

And the week is to end with a folk music and dance festival at the World Trade Center on Saturday from noon to 8 P.M.The Brooklyn players were led by Silvio Barbato, a Brazilian conductor in his mid-30's, who compensated for the lack of program notes by speaking briefly about each work. The final two works on the program were by Antonio Carlos Gomes, a composer who flourished in the second half of the 19th century, a time when the notion of a Brazilian style was hardly a twinkle in composers' eyes. Barbato worked hard to bring out the spark in this music. MUSIC REVIEW"

Enrique Coria, who is from Argentina, switches between bluegrass guitar flatpicking and the techniques of classical and flamenco guitar; Matt Eakle's flute solos move from unsyncopated string-band-style runs to jazzy streaks and bent notes. Some of its exotica-- a dinky funk tune and a quasi-Arab, quasi- flamenco piece in which Mr. Grisman played his mandolin like an oud-- was mere rootless eclecticism. The encores were warmhearted tributes to the late Bill Monroe, the fountainhead of American mandolin playing, with guests ( Jon Sholle on guitar and Gene Lowinger on fiddle ) and a surprise: Mr. Grisman sang.

But its most stunning provision would forbid any court in the United States except the Supreme Court to enjoin the Immigration and Naturalization Service from continuing a practice that is against the law or the Constitution.

George Pataki and other New York officials have expressed deep concern at provisions of the recently enacted welfare reform law that would make immigrants ineligible for some Federal programs. The immigration bill, as drafted by the Republican conferees, would go farther. Not only in the drastic asylum provision but in petty matters the bill would turn the screw on immigrants."

Many companies link their Web pages to their financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission at the Edgar data base and offer an E-mail form for requesting printed shareholder information like an annual report. The company's site answers many routine questions about stock prices and a dividend reinvestment program. Also, updating the information on the site is inexpensive and quick, she said, so much so that many Colgate-Palmolive employees find out company information on the Internet long before a news release reaches their desks."

The series of peace accords signed since March 1994 cover human rights, Mayan rights, social welfare and land ownership and set up a Commission on Clarification to deal with past abuses.

It is straightforward and stylish work. James Billings, a veteran Gilbert and Sullivan performer, makes a solid debut as director. Ideally, this music wants vocalists who can project words with the clarity of the best Broadway singers, yet who have the requisite vocal culture that this sophisticated music demands. Not surprisingly, the cast members with the least operatic-sounding voices-- Mr. Billings and the earthy mezzo-soprano Diana Daniele, who sang Little Buttercup-- had the clearest diction. If anything, his work was almost too reverent. That said, he brought stylistic understanding and sympathy to his work, which could be said of this entire production."

That stole the G.O.P.'s big issue. Worst of all, it would signal that if re-elected, Clinton would promptly bring back the era of big government. What's one big advantage these potential workers offer prospective employers? When combined with welfare reform's work requirement, making cheap labor more expensive is public-policy stupidity. If one worker takes full advantage of his entitlement of family leave time, and another shows up for work every day, which one is likelier to get ahead?The worker who is on the job regularly will do better ( and be a better provider ) than the one who takes full advantage of the new entitlement to stay home."

"Editorial supports experiment with year-round public schools in New York City to relieve intolerable overcrowding; says inconvenience to parents must take back seat to fact that children are not getting adequate education when they are packed into classrooms, or taught in hallways ","The idea of year-round public schools is suddenly getting attention in New York City. Putting children on a staggered schedule over 12 months would allow each school to handle up to 25 percent more students. Money now targeted for new buildings could be used instead for repairs, computers and new science labs. The C.B.C. paints a tempting vision of a New York City in which all the schools are in a good state of repair, with plenty of classroom space and up-to-date technology. The district that agrees to try the year-round school experiment should also be targeted for fast-track building repairs and technological updating. Some new schools will still have to be built, and the existing ones must be repaired at a rate faster than present funding allows. But experimenting with year-round schools must be part of the mix."

"Editorial notes Bob Dole has begun attacking Pres Clinton on drugs and crime; says Dole's legislative record on gun control undercuts his campaign effort to depict himself as tough on crime, while Clinton has solid record on guns; says as for drugs, both Clinton and Dole can rightfully accuse each other of ignoring the problem until fairly recently ","The Republican candidate's poor gun-control record makes it unlikely that he can reclaim the crime issue for his own. That was before the upsurge in drug use among teen-agers. These attacks, however, are not so much about drugs as about Mr. Dole's attempts to invigorate the character issue. Clinton's solid record on guns includes standing up to the gun lobby to help enact the assault weapons ban and the Brady bill, which requires a waiting period for handgun purchases.

"Brief excerpt from Bob Dole address at rally in Grayslake, Ill (S) ","BOB DOLESpeaking at a rally in Grayslake, Ill., That was the day Bill Clinton told Congress and the American people that the Federal Government should be in charge of heath care, that the Federal Government should take over health care. It would have created 50 brand new Federal bureaucracies, countless new laws and Federal penalties, and put one-seventh of the U.S. economy under Government control. So do n't forget this liberal in the White House who now talks like a moderate or conservative or Republican.''Maybe worst of all, the Clinton plan gave the Federal Government a role in nearly every health-care decision currently made by you and your doctor. And for the privilege of having the Government get between you and your doctor, they would have imposed a total of 17 new taxes on American workers."

Newspaper begin undertaking cooperative ventures to reduce production and distribution costs in face of competition for vital advertising dollars; cartoon (M) ,"NEWSPAPER people like to consider themselves as among the most competitive of people, even if their scoops seldom make their papers any richer. Because of this threat, newspaper business managers have begun to huddle together in joint cooperative ventures that would have been unthinkable a decade or two ago. Since 1990, Knight-Ridder and the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns Newsday and The Los Angeles Times, among other papers, have pooled their national advertising sales efforts in a joint venture with several other independent newspapers called Newspapers First. USA Today tried to interest The Wall Street Journal in building joint printing plants around the country for the two national newspapers in the 1980's."

Q&amp;A column on science answers question on whether one can see lunar eclipse in daylight ,"Yes, though only for a few minutes, and only if the eclipse is occurring just as the Moon is rising and the Sun is setting, or the Moon is setting and the Sun rising, said Joe Rao, a meteorologist and astronomer with Skyway Inc., a private astronomy information concern. For the same reason, day and night are not exactly equal at the time of the fall equinox, because the day is artificially lengthened a few minutes at each end by the refractive effect of the atmosphere, for a total of seven minutes. It does not begin until 9:12 P.M. in the New York area. C.

"Archeologists working at remote site in northwestern Australia find what may be oldest rock art in world; walls engraved with circles are dated at up to 75,000 years old; photo; Dr Richard L K Fullager comments (S) ","ARCHEOLOGISTS and specialists in the study of early humans are mystified by the discovery, announced last week, of what appears to be the oldest rock art in the world. They have been dated at up to 75,000 years old, which would make them at least 15,000 years older than any other Australian art and more than twice the age of France's earliest rock art. The archeologists, led by Dr. Richard L. K. Fullagar of the Australian Museum in Sydney, said the circles, no matter how primitive in appearance, were definitely art, but they could not say what the creators might have been trying to express. Aborigines who live in the region, however, recount that the rock outcrops represent ancestral beings who were turned to stone."

The building shown in your article was our third home. In our archives are plans by the architect Frederick Draper for the Broadway building in the daguerrotype.

Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein letter responds to Frank Rich Sept 18 Op-Ed column on Christian Coalition's convention ,"To the Editor: As one of two rabbis who spoke at the Christian Coalition's convention, I feel that Frank Rich ( column, Sept. 18 ) barely hid his disdain for my having legitimized the gathering and presumably compromised Jewish integrity. I challenged the delegates to respect diversity, demonstrate tolerance, support Israel, fight anti-Semitism and lead lives of faith by reaching out to all people. I am convinced that the invitation was not a hollow gesture but an attempt to reach out in friendship to Jews. Whether Jews agree with the coalition or not, this group is a responsible participant in the public policy dialogue. It was correct and appropriate for me to have spoken at its convention.(Rabbi ) YECHIEL ECKSTEIN Chicago, Sept. 20, 1996The writer is president of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews."
Adam Splaver letter responds to Thomas L Friedman Sept 22 article about Arab-Israel peace process ,"To the Editor: Writing about the Arab-Israel peace process, Thomas L. Friedman ( column, Sept. 22 ) presents Israel's Orthodox Jews as fighting the advance of technology and the global village. As an American Orthodox Jew who has lived in Israel, I can say that only a minority of the Orthodox are of this mind-set. Friedman suggests that peace and religion may not be able to coexist in the Orthodox world. Orthodoxy is not against peace. But just as there are as many ways to get from point A to point B, so there are many ways of achieving peace. Prime Minister Shimon Peres's quest for peace endangered Israel's security."

Personal Computers column gives update on advances in modem technology (S) ,"For most Internet users at home, bandwidth it determined by modem speed. The most common modems in use today can send and receive 14,400 bits per second ( 14.4 kilobits ) over standard telephone lines. Earlier this year a new but not universally adopted modem standard called V.34 bis emerged, offering data transmission speeds of roughly 33,600 bits ( 33.6 kilobits ) per second. The physical speed limit can not be exceeded by today's analogue, wave-form modems, except through tricks like data compression. The V.56 modems achieve the higher incoming speed, and circumvent Shannon's Law, by relying on the new digital phone circuits now being installed by most telephone companies and used by many, but not all, Internet service providers."

All along the lower reaches of the Truckee River, patches of cottonwoods are beginning to cover the raw banks. Natural cottonwood regeneration depends on just the right combination of spring floods and summer water levels; the levels must drop slowly enough that young tree roots beside the river can stay in contact with the declining water table. The river level was slowly lowered throughout the summer. Scott said water levels on the Truckee were controlled until mid-August to make sure that the cottonwood forest established a beachhead.'' He traced the trees to the summer of 1987, when water was released for the endangered cui-ui to spawn upriver from Pyramid Lake."

"Letter by Michael Raskin, one of lawyers representing New York City high school student accused of taking gun to school, disagrees with several interpretations being made about case ","To the Editor: As one of the lawyers representing the New York City high school student accused of taking a gun to school, I disagree with interpretations that are being made about this case. As you say ( editorial, Sept. 21 ), the court's decision does not change school employees' right to search students. The Appellate Division affirmed the principle that the government may not benefit from its own illegality-- that is, a school employee may not conduct an illegal search of a student and then use the illegally obtained evidence against the student. This was a conservative decision made by conservative judges, not liberal activist judges."
"Two research groups report seeing, at molecular level, damage to myelin protein that is cause of three genetic nerve disorders; technique called X-ray crystallography enables researchers to pinpoint how atoms in one molecule of protein attach to another, or fail to attach when gene is faulty; photos; diagram; three disorders involve white or myelin sheath, which wraps nerves outside brain and spinal cord; key to breakdown is protein called P-zero that is chief structural element in myelin; work was done at Baylor College of Medicine and Columbia University (M) ","The disorders are all examples of what happens when the myelin sheath breaks down, interfering with electrical nerve impulses to and from the spinal cord. When the gene for P-zero is defective, the myelin can not wrap itself tightly around the nerve and may break down altogether. The paper in Neuron from the Baylor scientists described five new mutations in the P-zero gene and how they disable the P-zero protein. Depending on how well the protein functions with each mutation, the authors write, a person with the mutation may have different levels of damage to nerve function. When nerve signals fail, illness can result as muscles fail to respond to the nerves and become numb. These sheaths are each wrapped dozens of times around each nerve. What makes the layers stick together is the P-zero proteins."

New York Rangers training camp notes; entire roster will be gathered together for first time (M) ,"Practicing with the team were the biggest stars: Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky, Adam Graves, Brian Leetch and Mike Richter. The top two lines, judging from combinations used today, will put Messier between Adam Graves and Luc Robitaille followed by Gretzky between Aleksei Kovalev and Sergei Nemchinov. If Nemchinov stays as left wing on that line, it is likely he will play the safety role, remaining high in the zone while Gretzky and Kovalev gamble. Nemchinov, usually a center on the Rangers, played left wing on Russia's top line in the World Cup, and impressed Campbell. Gretzky joined the Rangers this summer as a free agent after playing last season in Los Angeles and St. Louis.''I sense good chemistry already,'' Messier said of the team."

Karl F Schmid letter responds to Sept 17 editorial calling for sanctions against Nigeria to stop its human rights abuses ,"To the Editor: Your call for sanctions against Nigeria to stop its human rights abuses ( editorial, Sept. 17 ) reminds me of burned-out fuses. As a facilities manager, I once found 14 burned-out fuses below a fire alarm panel that had a blinking light indicating that something was wrong with the system. The technician had replaced the fuse 14 times. Over the years the United States has imposed sanctions against Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran and Iraq. To what end? The leaders of these countries remain in place. I can not think of one leader who has been ousted because of sanctions. But the common people have suffered. Your call for sanctions against Nigeria is like installing the 15th fuse. KARL F. SCHMID New York, Sept. 17. 1996"
Peter Watrous Critic's Choice review of recordings of Caribbean music (S) ,"The Caribbean still produces some of the world's best dance music, with the relationship between the improvisers on the dance floor and those on the bandstand guaranteeing that the music holds to especially high standards. Formell's band, Los Van Van, has been Cuba's best dance band for several decades, an orchestra with an experimental sensibility. ('' God, Protect Me!'' ), recorded for the Inspector de la Salsa label from Havana, is a step forward, an unceasingly hard dance album with good fidelity. The album is as good an example of the modern Cuban sound as exists, unalloyed dance music at its best. Though the music has fierce dance grooves, a lightness and clarity pervade the album; the musicians are dedicated to equality among instruments."

Flight 800, Professors Charles Hailey and David Helfand correctly note that there is a big difference between the likelihood of a commercial plane ever getting hit by a meteor in a 30-year span and the likelihood of a specific plane on a specific flight getting hit by a meteor. The odds of such a freak accident downing a specific flight remain small, and the professors' conclusion that'' the meteor impact theory deserves more considered attention'' is difficult to support."

It was the beginning of his conviction that selection acted on groups, not only genes. It's an instance, Dr. Wilson says, in which group selection is outweighing individual selection. Genes compete with other genes within an animal; animals compete with other animals within a group; and groups compete with other groups; and megagroups made up of groups compete with other megagroups. Conversely, a biological individual can be seen as a group, within which selfish genes compete. In fact, one of the best individuals did terribly in groups.''"

"Outlook for Atlantic Richfield Co discussed; firm, under pressure to replace falling reserves and output of its Alaskan oil fields, has formed joint venture with Russian oil firm Lukoil to bring Russian oil to market (M) ","Among the primary prospects for ARCO and other Western oil companies are Russia and some of the former Soviet republics like Kazakstan and Azerbaijan. Rather than form a consortium of Western companies to battle the Byzantine bureaucracies of the region, ARCO has teamed up with Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company. In the race to bring oil from Russia to market, the venture is not wasting time.'' It is under pressure to replace reserves and production because crude oil output is expected to fall about 6 percent a year from its Alaskan fields. The company's daily production of crude oil has fallen to 850,000 barrels a day from about 950,000 three years ago. Some of the other ventures by Western oil companies have often hit snags in seeking favorable terms in production agreements."

Yeltsin has turned over some of his powers to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, including control over the powerful ministries that manage Russian foreign policy and domestic law enforcement. The intense rivalries are partly the legacy of Mr. Yeltsin's centralized leadership, which denied real power to any aide so that the President's power would remain supreme.

New York Giants victory over New York Jets discussed; Giants seen unable to control line of scrimmage and run the ball at will as they once did (M) ,"The era of Giants' smash-mouth football is over. That offensive line was one of the most dominant ever in the National Football League. The league average before Monday night's Indianapolis-Miami game was 3.8 yards a carry and the Giants were averaging 3.1 yards. ' We're making progress,'' said the offensive line coach, Pete Mangurian.' The running game is going to have to improve if the Giants expect to beat teams other than the Jets. The promising part for the Giants is that at least the line is still young. While the mistakes continue-- Gragg admitted after the Jets game he made two big ones-- over all the line is made up of smart players who are not set in their ways."

New Juilliard Ensemble opens its season at Juilliard Theater under conductor Joel Sachs; photo of Sachs and soprano Johanna Wiseman; Alex Ross review (M) ,"Two English composers, two Chinese composers and an Irish composer-- The group opened its season on Saturday night in the Juilliard Theater. No punch line was needed: each composer's conversation sounded lively on its own. These Bachian elements blend magically with citations of medieval plainsong and the composer's usual variation on Schoenbergian method ( considerably brightened by tonality ). The two Chinese works benefited from exceptional richness of instrumentation. Jia Daqun's'' Intonation,'' receiving its world premiere, was more conventional in its vocabulary, leaning on the familiar'' sound field'' style of composition ( overlapping glissandos, hazy cluster chords ) as well as traditional Chinese folk elements. The student musicians of the New Juilliard Ensemble thrived on the challenges of all these pieces. MUSIC REVIEW"
Singer Barbara Cook pays tribute to Oscar Hammerstein 2d at Cafe Carlyle; photo; Stephen Holden review (S) ,"You could n't ask for a more compatible pairing than the singer Barbara Cook and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d, whom she is honoring in her wonderful new show at the Cafe Carlyle ( Madison Avenue at 76th Street ). With her gold-trimmed lyric soprano and gift for conveying the rush of emotion in a way that is at once broadly theatrical, deeply personal and without affectation, Ms. Cook is the vocal embodiment of Hammerstein's esthetic of balanced uplift. You Are.''The material is divided evenly between lyrics Hammerstein wrote with the composer Richard Rodgers and those he wrote with Jerome Kern, with an additional Sigmund Romberg collaboration.

Performance artist John Kelly gives tribute to Joni Mitchell at Westbeth Theater Center; Stephen Holden review (S) ,"John Kelly's alternately worshipful and uproarious tribute to Joni Mitchell. Although Mr. Kelly dons a blond wig and wears overlaying granny dresses to impersonate the star in her post-hippie folk-singing days,'' Paved Paradise'' is less a drag act than a surreal hommage. Only someone who has absorbed every nuance of every Joni Mitchell recording could have come up with a vocal caricature as lovingly devastating as Mr. Kelly's."
Frank J Piral Wine Talk column on German wines; comments on Jordan Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon; photo (M) ,"WHAT has to be done to stir up interest in German wines? Twenty years ago, good wines from the Rhine and the Mosel were an integral part of any serious wine cellar. Many reasons have been advanced for the recent eclipse of German wines. The best German wines mature as well as or better than many Burgundies and clarets. Many collectors of German wines are still enjoying their 1976's, 1971's and 1959's. And it is the ability of the German wines to age so well that may be part of their problem. Many wines from the 1989 and 1990 vintages are only now beginning to show how good they are. A typical German wine label can have 14 different bits of information on it. Wine Talk"

In addition, fiber claims must follow certain guidelines.'' The coarser the grain, in bread and indeed all grain products, the higher the fiber content. Raw foods are often higher in fiber than cooked, but in some cases, it depends on how the food is cooked. For instance, toasting and sauteing most foods can increase their fiber content. An increase in fiber should be accompanied by an increase in fluid intake. Without enough liquid, fiber can plug up the intestines. As for fiber supplements, as the American Cancer Society stated in its guidelines, food is always a better way."

FDA approves a new breath test for diagnosing bacterial infection of stomach that is linked to peptic ulcers; Meretek UBT Breath Test will be available to doctors late next month (M) ,"ALTHOUGH doctors have learned in recent years that most peptic ulcers are caused by a bacterial infection of the stomach, the infection has been hard to detect. In the long run it should reduce the cost of managing patients with ulcer disease.''The test detects the presence of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori. That organism was first recognized as a cause of peptic ulcers in the early 1980's. Medications designed to protect the stomach from acid did heal ulcers, but they often recurred. In 1994, the National Institutes of Health recommended that all ulcer patients with H. pylori infection be given antibiotic treatment.

"Rep Lamar Smith letter contends that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have entered US by destroying fraudulent travel documents, claiming asylum and never showing up for hearings; maintains that anti-terrorism law will end this practice by requiring expedited review of asylum claims at port of entry ","To the Editor: Tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have entered this country by destroying fraudulent travel documents, claiming asylum and never showing up for hearings. The anti terrorism law, effective Nov. 1, will end this practice by requiring an expedited review of asylum claims at the port of entry. This procedure is a common-sense balance between securing our borders and protecting asylum seekers. But he should consider that many illegal immigrants arriving at airports receive false documents from organized crime syndicates. Expedited removal of illegal immigrants protects legitimate refugees. Initial interviews will be conducted by full-time asylum officers or people with identical training. Any individual immigrant may still sue the agency and obtain specific relief, but broad class-action suits, brought mostly on behalf of illegal immigrants, will be curtailed."

When heartburn, or acid reflux, occurs, this barrier to stomach contents fails to function properly and some of the acidic material swirls back up into the esophagus and may cause that familiar burning sensation beneath the sternum, or chest bone. Certain foods and circumstances increase the likelihood of heartburn and its symptoms. But while the typical symptoms of occasional heartburn are momentarily discomforting, the underlying damage done by chronic acid reflux can result in serious illness. This is why simply squelching the symptoms of heartburn is not adequate therapy. The goal of therapy should be to stop or greatly reduce acid reflux."

Editorial contends that for decades Swiss banking industry's stonewalling on its role in Nazi period has now broken down under intense pressure from Jewish organizations and the unearthing of documentary records that show shameful extent of Swiss banking cooperation with Nazis; asserts that international pressure must be maintained to assure that banks do not slip back into their accustomed secrecy (M) ,"The cloistered Swiss banking industry has belatedly and reluctantly agreed to unlock two of its most disturbing secrets. A lingering mystery of the Nazi era is what happened to the gold, money and other valuables deposited in Swiss banks by Jews throughout Europe who were fearful their assets would be seized by Germany. The banks claimed that most of it had been transferred out of Switzerland by the time the war ended in 1945.For decades the Swiss banking industry arrogantly thwarted inquiries about its role in the Nazi period, and effectively discouraged the relatives of Holocaust victims searching for long-dormant accounts. The Swiss Government is now moving to relax bank secrecy laws, at least in this case, to allow a full investigation into Nazi gold deposits."
Editorial expresses concern over report by National Commission on Teaching and America's Future that teaching corps is too weak to meet demands of information age and will fall even shorter unless higher and more uniform standards are put in place (M) ,"A well-trained and accomplished teacher can make a dramatic difference in a child's life. But teaching requirements vary widely by state. Across America, nearly a quarter of newly hired teachers are unlicensed. Only about half of mathematics teachers have undergraduate degrees in math. Nearly a third of math teachers do n't even have a math minor. Far too many teachers are hired in emergencies, more on the basis of patronage than qualifications. Poor teacher salaries have played an obvious role. Governor Hunt and his colleagues offer several measures for improving the teacher corps. Getting prospective teachers to invest that sort of time would require many states to raise salaries."
