"Ben Ratliff recommends going to Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, Tompkins Square Park (S) ","Charlie Parker Jazz Festival, Tompkins Square Park, Seventh Street and Avenue A, East Village, ( 212 ) 449- 9609. Now in its fourth year, this outdoor festival has become one of New York's must-attend jazz events. The pianist Randy Weston and his quintet open the long afternoon at 3.

Holland Cotter reviews exhibition of photographs by Bing Wright and Glen Luchford at Pace Wildenstin MacGill Gallery (S) ,"Bing Wright / Jenny Saville and Glen Luchford Wright's monochromatic photographs titled'' Wet Glass'' are exactly what they say they are: images of water trickling down or splashed across a sheet of glass. Hanging in the adjoining room are two huge color photographs by Glen Luchford of the English painter Jenny Saville, best known for her monumental nude self-portraits. Mr. Luchford has shot Ms. Saville's sensationally corpulent torso from below as she lies face down on a clear sheet of glass clutching and prodding her own sallow flesh. Mr. Luchford and Ms. Saville turn a pucker-and-sag physique reminiscent of a Lucian Freud portrait into something nearly abstract. In both sets of images, gravity is the central player, momentarily arrested perhaps, but implacably at work as water falls and all-too-solid flesh melts away."
"Jon Pareles reviews concert by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Pakistani singer of Sufi devotional songs, at Radio City Music Hall; photo (M) ","Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's concerts are religious celebrations and dance parties, virtuoso showcases and master classes. At Radio City Music Hall on Wednesday night, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan and Party, his 10-man group, sang about Allah, divine love and Sufi saints to a crowd that danced in the aisles despite the ushers' best efforts. Fateh Ali Khan is a household name in Pakistan, the best-known singer of the Sufi devotional songs called qawwali ( utterance ). A harmonium, played by the singer's brother Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan, murmured an introduction, setting out the song's mode.

Stephen Holden reviews movie Madagascar Skin; photo (M) ,"That hopeful message reveals itself only gradually in Chris Newby's exquisitely photographed film'' Madagascar Skin,'' lifting what begins as a depressive reverie into a surreal comic ode to unlikely erotic fulfillment. Harry frantically saves the stranger, a tattooed window cleaner named Flint ( Bernard Hill ), from imminent drowning. Mr. Newby, an English film maker, directed in a hallucinatory style that gives every shot a Zenlike focus and concentration. As Flint fantasizes aloud about a woman in a bikini, Harry has his own sexual daydreams about his companion. Suddenly, out of the blue, Flint makes Harry a sexual proposition. This film is not rated. Bernard Hill ( Flint ) and John Hannah ( Harry).FILM REVIEW"
"Brief review by Janet Maslin of theatrical film Mary Reilly, now on home video; photo (S) ","Mary Reilly 1996. That maid out scrubbing the front stoop is none other than Julia Roberts, becomingly humble in the title role of servant girl to Dr. Jekyll ( John Malkovich ). Stephen Frears's film, which adapts not Robert Louis Stevenson's novel but Valerie Martin's, chronicles dark and strange goings-on in the Jekyll household through the eyes of a shy young maid. It is left to Mr. Malkovich to supply any eroticism as the mockingly sensual Hyde and the repressed, only slightly less lascivious Jekyll. Stolidly gardening and sewing away even after gruesome discoveries in the doctor's laundry, Ms. Roberts gives, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,'' a solemnly repetitive performance without much spark.''"

Ben Ratliff reviews performance by Dave Holland at Iridium (S) ,"His bass lines, played with a commandeering power, are pitched down low on the instrument, and lean more toward pure resonance than melodic invention. The end result is the sort of serenity that seems to be the point of so much post-Coltrane jazz, yet is n't achieved all that often. Steve Nelson, in a deliberative mood, played chords as long-sustained colors on his vibraphone, letting layers of overtones hang in the air and ring together. Mr. Nelson handled the winding, rhythmic melodies in tandem with the alto saxophonist Eric Person, whose clean, sweet tone gathered momentum and became a carefully calibrated braying at the end of a solo. Holland anchored the action with his big-toned but buzzless bass lines."

"William Gottlieb letter on bunching of New York City buses; says little has changed since he drove bus in 1981, with regard to Transit Authority's ability to play the public for fools; says real problem is lack of buses (S) ","To the Editor: I learned from your Aug. 18 news article on bus-bunching that one thing has n't changed since I last drove a New York City bus in 1981: the willingness of the Transit Authority to play the public for fools. On the M15 route I drove in Manhattan, dispatchers along the line routinely cut short a bus's route ( short-signing ) or told a driver to skip stops ( drop-off only ) to break up bus bunches. The main reason for poor bus service, including off-schedule buses running together, is that since the 1970's the T.A. has cut drastically the number of buses plying its routes. The T.A. knows this, as do the bus drivers and dispatchers who suffer with passengers when lines do n't run well."

Kaye's experience in criminal court with mixed feelings ( news article, Aug. 16 ). Some of her jury-service reforms are most welcome. The automatic age exemption of 70 is no longer in effect. I have been called for jury duty every two years since I was 21, including several lengthy stints as a grand juror ( not endearing me much to my employers ). Doing away with 70 as the jury retirement age discriminates against older citizens who have served for decades, and sentences those performing their civic duty to spending more time in the New York justice system than most convicted felons.

"A M Rosenthal Op-Ed column on alarm over sharp rise in teen-age drug use, at time when adult use has abated; charges adults, including journalists, have abandoned duty to protect children from known and contagious evil (S) ","The newspapers and TV tell us we are in a new teen-age drug crisis. For adults in general, America is moving upward out of drugs. Among adults drug use has remained flat in the past few years and gone down 50 percent since 1985. Almost all Americans who escaped the drug epidemic went through childhood and adolescence without regular drug use. That reality is the importance, and validity, of the drug war. Ninety percent of adult cocaine users, for instance, started using drugs as teen-agers, and usually with marijuana. Children who do not get the anti-drug message from their parents are more likely to become drug users than those who do. Mr. Burke says children are receiving less anti-drug information and more glamorization of drug use as acceptable, and even normal."

Taxi drivers often pick up and discharge passengers on either side of the street, creating traffic tie-ups and hazards. Some taxis are filthy, or assault passengers with ear-piercing music, or both.

This plan, which circumvents formal conference procedure, could allow the treaty to be opened for signing if it passes the General Assembly. India can still, however, refuse to sign the treaty and keep it from going into force, but a conference is required three years after approval to determine what to do if the treaty has not gone into force. The Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty, the product of more than two years of negotiations, has significant support, but negotiators want as many nations as possible to sponsor the action in the General Assembly."

That's because the gigs are in her living room. Most Sunday afternoons, the sounds of cascading piano runs, thumping bass notes and roller-coaster scat singing fill the tiny room for the enjoyment of several dozen people. Once, this mammoth building was home to such jazz greats as Johnny Hodges and Andy Kirk. I grew up with the concept of doing it in the living room.

Bob Herbert Op-Ed column quotes surgeon William G Cahan's chilling accounts of nicotine addicts who continue smoking even when deathly ill with cancer; praises Pres Clinton's promised crackdown on marketing and sale of cigarettes to young people (S) ,"Anyone who doubts the potency of nicotine's addictive qualities should listen to Dr. William G. Cahan, senior attending surgeon at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, as he talks about desperately ill patients whose cravings for a cigarette are not diminished by even the most macabre circumstances. Specialists routinely warn cancer patients that continued smoking could further jeopardize their immune systems, thus increasing the danger that the cancer will spread or that a new cancer will develop.''Nevertheless,'' said Dr. Cahan,'' some can not quit. Not surprisingly, some larynx patients develop a separate primary lung cancer.''Dr. Tobacco companies have long known that they need to lasso their new smokers at a very early age."
"Editorial says Pres Clinton should heed those in his Administration who counsel against sale of F-16 fighter jets to Indonesia, at bargain prices; warns that sale would suggest US endorsement of Pres Shuharto's autocratic, corrupt Government (M) ","President Clinton should heed those in his Administration who counsel against the planned sale of F-16 fighter jets at bargain prices to Indonesia. President Suharto has jailed hundreds of political opponents this summer in a new wave of repression. Selling fighter jets to Indonesia before Mr. Suharto institutes serious political reforms would seem a blanket American endorsement of an autocratic and corrupt Government. Indonesia's vibrant economic growth has not yet been accompanied by democratic reforms. The recent crackdown began after the Government ousted Megawati Sukarnoputri from the leadership of the authorized opposition party. Megawati has never criticized Mr. Suharto, but has called for democratic reforms. If there is to be an F-16 sale, it should be conditioned on a speedy end to the repression and the institution of democratic reforms."
"Editorial on alarming sharp increase in drug use among teen-agers; says most sensible response is to beef up less glamorous prevention, education and treatment programs that are too often cut from budgets (M) ","Drug use among teen-agers, once on the wane, is again rising sharply. A Federal report issued this week found that the percentage of adolescents currently using drugs more than doubled in four years, from a low of 5.3 percent in 1992 to 10.9 percent in 1995. Much of the increased drug use is accounted for by marijuana, which is by far the most frequently used drug. Some experts think the increased tolerance for drug use is generational. Many baby-boomer parents of teen drug users probably used drugs themselves, and therefore have not offered stern enough warnings about the dangers."

The first leg required a tough man to clean up what was clearly an outlaw town full of bleach throwers, bad actors and bad players. As for Green, for the better part of a year, he has been the touchy-feely Mr. Chips the Mets said they wanted. After all, if Green is ultimately responsible for Wilson and Isringhausen, then credit him for John Franco, Pete Harnisch's comeback, Alex Ochoa's blossoming and the career years of Bernard Gilkey, Lance Johnson and that wondrous work in progress, Todd Hundley. Truth is, the Mets are getting better."

There was always a feeling that budget cuts could be accomplished later. Instead, the tax cuts combined with rising defense and debt-service costs to run up trillions of dollars in new debt. Mr. Darman argues that in programmatic terms, there was no Reagan revolution.'' Indeed, Mr. Dole has been going around the country walling off various entitlement programs from future budget cuts. The supporters of both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole are going to have to work together to cut the Federal budget, with or without a tax cut."

"Many voters say they doubt Bob Dole could fulfill his promise to cut taxes and balance Federal budget, but economists are even more skeptical about his pledge to raise economic growth level to 3.5 percent, from curent level of less than 2.5 percent; economists believe American economy cannot now grow much faster than 2.5 percent without igniting inflation (S) ","Dole's target is not just to increase growth for a quarter or two. Economists have boiled the nation's capacity for economic growth down to a simple equation: the sum of labor force growth and productivity growth. To raise the economy's capacity for sustainable, non- inflationary growth to 3.5 percent, therefore, would require nearly doubling the rate of productivity growth, to more than 2 percent, economists said. His economic advisers said they could not quantify precisely how tax cuts or deregulation, for example, would improve productivity and the growth rate. But you have to understand where the underpinnings of growth come from."

That argument suggests that the most powerful nation in the world is the prisoner of intelligence services in other nations that share with us only what they wish us to see."

"Bradley Miller letter says resentment that drives anti-abortionists is rooted in puritanism seen in earlier prohibitionist crusades, which would seek to punish deviations from prescribed morality (S) ","To the Editor: Susan Faludi, in'' The G.O.P.'s Back Stairs'' ( Op-Ed, Aug. 18 ), rightly calls attention to the rarely mentioned class factor in the abortion debate. In fact, most agree with the Republican Party on economic as well as social issues. No group promoted Newt Gingrich's Contract With America more than the Christian Coalition. The resentment that drives anti-abortionists is of a different character. The most important thread running through such crusades is neither religious fanaticism nor resentment of economic power by the powerless, though both are factors, but rather a puritan resentment of those who partake of a wide variety of pleasures generally foreign to the experience, if not the capacity, of the resentful. That resentment seeks to punish deviations from the morality prescribed."

Similarly, gun control, another issue opposed by Buchananites, is less about guns than it is about control-- the feeling that government is increasingly restricting their choices. A psychological buzzword a few years ago was'' locus of control.'' It described whether individuals felt they had control over their lives ( internal locus ) or whether they felt powerless because others were pulling the strings ( external locus ). As Ms. Faludi points out, the analysis is still valid. CHARLES DAVISSeattle, Aug. 19, 1996Abortion Debate Is n't Fueled by Economics"
"Op-Ed article by Chester E Finn Jr, fellow at Hudson Institute, says publicly financed charter schools are becoming one of fiercest battlegrounds in education; says battle has shifted from whether to permit schools to exist, about 350 are now in operation, to whether they will be allowed to operate independently, free of pressure from unions, local school boards and district bureaucarats; notes nearly all charter schools have waiting lists and are being sought out not by parents of privileged children but by families least well served by conventional schools (M) ","The fight is no longer about whether to permit the schools to exist. To date, 25 states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, have authorized charter schools, and the new school year will see about 350 in operation. Union contracts, with their cumbersome rules for who does what and how school decisions are made, are precisely what many teachers in charter schools have escaped. Most charter schools prefer to hire certified instructors Charter schools are accountable for results rather than for obeying rules. Indeed, nearly all charter schools have waiting lists. Yet in every state we visited, the unions have sought to keep the charter schools as few in number and weak as possible. By eroding the monopoly of the unions, charter schools threaten their control."

Today, the widow of a tobacco industry lobbyist who died from cigarette addiction lavished heartfelt praise on Mr. Clinton at a ceremony celebrating new Federal regulatory controls over tobacco as a drug.

But Prince Ranariddh said this week that Khmer Rouge leaders, who boycotted elections in 1993, would not be eligible to hold Cabinet posts in the current Government. He also said he would ask Parliament to rescind a 1994 law outlawing the Khmer Rouge.

Peter Passell analysis of debate over Bob Dole's proposal to reduce Federal income tax by 15 percent; question of whether tax cuts stimulate economic growth discussed (M) ,"But once the economy reaches its productive capacity, the long-term growth rate depends on improvements in savings, investment, work effort and technology. From 1946 through 1973, output per worker rose by an average annual rate of 2.7 percent. From 1974 through 1995, by contrast, growth in labor productivity averaged just 1.1 percent annually.

Indeed, in the first quarter of 1984, output rose at an annual rate of 11.4 percent. The Dole plan, of course, includes more than just tax cuts."

History is made, myths invented and art created by people operating within particular cultural contexts. Mature understandings of history, myth and art therefore depend heavily on being conversant with the cultures from which they originate. Colleges, however, tend vastly to underestimate the familiarity students must have with another culture in order to appreciate its history, mythology, religion or art. For me, to appreciate the sculpture I needed answers to questions about everything from Hindu iconography to the significance of'' art'' in South Asian cultures."

This resolution deserves our support. Although valuable legislative information has been placed online by Congress, committee prints and amendments to existing bills are generally not available to ordinary citizens.

Perot, the Texas computer billionaire, was picked last weekend to carry the throw-the-rascals-out-of-Washington banner of the Reform Party, which he founded and funded after a strong showing as an independent in 1992. On the other hand, Mr. Nader, nominated Monday by the Green Party, might weaken Mr. Clinton competing for the anti-Dole vote."

By contrast, Mr. Dole is behind in so many states that he needs to raise his popularity nationally before he can embark on a state-by-state strategy. The state is so crucial to Mr. Clinton that he has practically made it a second home.

Dole planned to needle Mr. Clinton one more time at a Sunday picnic outside Chicago before retiring to a low-profile week devoted mostly to a vacation.

That figure is below the peak of the late 1970's, but up from the 10-year low in 1992.The jump may be due in part to the fact that many parents of today's youths once used drugs themselves and feel sheepish about warning their children off them.

The abortion liberty is thus legitimated today by incompatible theories: one based on the will of the majority, the other on the nature of the right. The joint opinion of Justices David H.

Ben Krull letter on Aug 20 analysis of bob Dole's plan to cut taxes and balance budget (S) ,"To the Editor: Even if Bob Dole justifiably believes that the Federal budget can be balanced atop a 15 percent tax cut ( news analysis, Aug. 20 ), his economic platform still fails to address the forces driving America's tenuous job market. According to supply-siders, tax cuts stimulate growth and create new jobs. Many large businesses, despite reaping record profits, are laying off employees to satisfy the stock market's preference for lean payrolls. While job growth has kept up with corporate downsizing, foreign competition and the economy's drift toward the service sector have spawned new jobs that are either low-paying or require skills that many displaced workers do n't have. Dole's prescription for the economy may give some temporary relief to strapped wage-earners."

In the early stories of this retrospective collection, Mr. Albahari writes about a stiflingly close Jewish household in the Belgrade suburb of Zemun; as the members of the family struggle to love one another, their conflicts are sometimes comic and often absurd. In his later stories, Mr. Albahari peers into the chasms that gape between a husband and wife-- and, even more dizzyingly, between a writer and his reader."

Again the liberal civil rights forces built on Catholic tradition when they took to the streets in the 60's. Civil rights marches felt so incendiary to white working-class Catholics in part because they assaulted the idea of neighborhood itself. As the book progresses, that conflict pushes aside the treatment of the actual lives of Catholics, black and white. Race becomes the ideological pivot on which two groups of white Catholics, and a few black priests, vie for the future of their church."

Windham (Conn) asks State Transportation Dept to place 4 bronze frogs on new bridge in Willimantic section of town to pay tribute to local legend; bridge project is expected to cost about $14 million; photos; drawing (M)&#xFFFD; ,"Now Windham-- and the frogs-- could have the last laugh. The town has asked the State Department of Transportation to place four bronze frogs on a new bridge in the Willimantic section of town, to pay tribute to a local legend. Years ago the state tried to give its bridges character, she noted. Town leaders have been lobbying the state for a new bridge for many years, deeming the two bridges currently connecting the north and south ends of town inadequate. The Bridge Street bridge is even older, built in 1868. 52 is the Windham Frog Fight. The old Windham Bank soon issued currency with frogs on it. Progress can not be measured simply by the number of lanes on a new bridge,'' Mr. Grover said.''"

The 1994 opening in White Plains of the Westchester Pavilion, a 275,000-square-foot power center with competitive-priced merchandisers, and the opening last year of The Westchester, an upscale, one-million-square-foot mall, initially threatened to draw away business from the Galleria.

He said five stores have closed in The Westchester since the mall opened. ' They go to different shopping centers for different needs."
"New Jersey commercial seafood industry, once dominated by fishermen with small boats working close to shore, has become industry of big boats fishing offshore; catches of high-value fish have declined while catches of lower-priced fish have increased; problems facing industry discussed; photos; graphs of top categories of catch (L)a ","New Jersey's 300-year-old commercial fishing industry has been utterly transformed in recent years. The result is this: In the last five years, notwithstanding over-fished stocks, government quotas, creeping coastal development and increasing political pressure from environmental groups and the recreational fishing industry, New Jersey's 1,800-plus commercial fishing boats have caught more seafood, more consistently, than at any time since the early 1960's. More than 177 million pounds of fish and shellfish landed here last year, enough to make the state with the puny 127-mile coastline the country's ninth biggest seafood producer. Much British fish and chips is made with New Jersey dogfish backs. At Belford, the closest New Jersey port to Manhattan, some fishermen are doing more with less by selling their fish live."
"Letter from Gene Lyons says Phil Gailey's Aug 4 review of his book, Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented Whitewater, was perfect illustration of his book's theme, that nation's Washington press corp thinks it is beyond reproach (M) ","Here's what the book says:''' Reporters who pore over politicians' words with the rapt attention of an I.R.S. auditor scrutinizing a bookie's tax return-- searching out inconsistencies, gaffes, flip-flops, anything they can call' news'-- recoil in horror at their own work getting anything like the same treatment. Hence Whitewater.''My book alleges no conspiracy other than the self-aggrandizement of reporters whose practices-- carefully documented in every instance-- no conscientious journalist can openly defend. All of which underlines a conclusion I came to early on in my research: If somebody came up with a Crybaby Award for the ability to dish it out but not take it, our nation's vaunted Washington press corps would soon retire the trophy."
"Letter from Roy Reed says Gene Lyons's book Fools for Scandal: How the Media Invented Whitewater, was right on the facts, and book's reviewer, Phil Gailey, was mistaken in his criticism of book (S)&#xFFFD; ","To the Editor: Phil Gailey and I both worked for The Times some years ago, and I have high regard for him. But I have to disagree with his review of Gene Lyons's'' Fools for Scandal.'' He seems to believe that Mr. Lyons's criticism of The Times for its Whitewater coverage is flawed because an institution like The Times is simply too good to make such mistakes. The only mistake I found in Mr. Lyons's book was his misidentification of me as a former London bureau chief for The Times. I worked in the London bureau, but not as the chief. As for Arkansas and the Whitewater story, Mr. Lyons's book is the best reporting I've seen on the subject. Roy Reed West Fork, Ark."

Martin. University of Georgia, $ 65.Long before H. L.

"Keith Bradsher reviews book The Critical Path: Inventing an Automobile and Reinventing a Corporation, by Brock Yates (S) ","By Brock Yates. Little, Brown, $ 24.95.The Chrysler Corporation's success is one of the mysteries of Detroit. Despite a history of quality problems in its cars, the company earns more profit per vehicle than any other automobile maker in the world.'' The Critical Path'' helps solve the riddle by describing the development of the current generation of Chrysler minivans. Brock Yates has written a lively book that should appeal to engineers, auto industry executives, minivan owners and readers of Car and Driver magazine, where Mr. Yates is a columnist. But general readers of business books may be disappointed by Mr. Yates's narrow focus. He seldom mentions Ford or General Motors or tries to draw broad conclusions, preferring instead to concentrate on details of car engineering while offering unstinting praise of Chrysler."

By Alfred H. Knight. Alfred H. Knight tells stories, covering subjects ranging from the imposition of a few rules for private mayhem by Alfred, the king of the Saxons, to the fine modulation of state violence enforced by the Rodney King case. Above all, Mr. Knight, a trial lawyer in Nashville and a former Federal prosecutor, celebrates Americans for their attention to universally applied civil liberties. Still, Mr. Knight worries that American law is no longer conversing with intelligent citizens but inflicting upon them law review articles'' suited for minds that enjoy reading annotated chess games'' and Supreme Court opinions with'' all of the grace and clarity of Communist propaganda tracts.''"
"Liesl Schillinger reviews book Bound and Gagged: Pornography and the Politics of Fantasy in America, by Laura Kipnis (S) ","By Laura Kipnis. Whatever its intentions, and despite its supply of provocative tidbits and occasional flashes of insight, Laura Kipnis's slim contribution to the great pornography debate suffers from a certain laziness, as shown by its dearth of hard facts, its disorganization and its amiable long-windedness. Ms. Kipnis, who teaches film at Northwestern University, is her own worst enemy, raising important arguments only to drop them as soon as the next giddy new thought hops into her mind. Her notion, for instance, that pornography may be vilified chiefly for reasons of class, not morality, because its users and actors are assumed to be lower-class brutes, deserves more serious treatment than she gives it."

Meet Marion, the vampire dominatrix who draws blood from her clients. ) The photographs by Sylvia Plachy, the staff photographer at The Village Voice, depict the brutal banality of the most transgressive behavior; a series about a middle-aged man who pays a woman to wrap him in plastic and then mummify him in concrete-- all within the confines of a crummy East Village walk-up-- is particularly disturbing."
"William Ferguson reviews book Cheaters, and Other Stories, by Dean Albarelli (S) ","By Dean Albarelli. , $ 20.95.If there's a unifying strategy in this strong first collection of stories, it's the way Dean Albarelli's protagonists move from an apparently disinterested contemplation of life into the realization that in one way or another they're actually observing themselves. In'' Flames,'' a Roman Catholic priest's sexual transgressions conflict with his doting mother's vision of what he is-- or, rather, of what she wishes him to be. In'' The Orthodox Brother,'' a young Jewish woman finds her identity painfully challenged in the conflict between strict religious observance and a complacent desire for assimilation.''"
Andy Solomon reviews book The Journal of Antonio Montoya by Rick Collignon (S) ,"THE JOURNAL OF ANTONIO MONTOYA By Rick Collignon. Jose Montoya's mother and father were killed early one warm August morning by a cow.'' But in this quirky story death is neither mighty nor dreadful enough to be climactic. This deceased yet chatty sister-in-law becomes just the first of the ghosts Ramona must live with. The problem, for both Ramona and Mr. Collignon, is less that the novel's dead characters are still living than that its living ones are half dead. This contrast is only heightened when Ramona is given a zesty journal written in 1924 by a relative, the village historian and sculptor Antonio Montoya. Readers may wish Mr. Collignon had given all his book's characters as much life, or provided more of a story line for them to fit into."

"Deborah Mason reviews book My Summer With George, by Marilyn French; drawing (M) ","By Marilyn French. Hermione Beldame, twice divorced and twice widowed, is a rich, successful New York romance novelist whose own love story embodies that formidable challenge of the last few decades: the tricky coupling of intimacy and equality.''The Women's Room,'' which anointed Ms. French in 1977 as the woman men ( and many of today's young feminists ) love to hate, was a gritty epic that denounced most men as villains and declared the near impossibility of mutually beneficial male-female relationships. Indeed, as George dawdles, Hermione uses her powers as a romance novelist to advance their relationship in her own mind, creating lyrical feminist daydreams: George moves to New York, but not to her apartment-- to the floor above."

So why ca n't men seem to do it?'').This display type, and any implication that it fostered, is the full responsibility of the editors, not the author.

"Mary R Standard letter scores David Kessler, commissioner of Food and Drug Administration, and his war on cigarettes ","You bet Kessler's out to infantilize the American people. Call it an occupational hazard of pediatricians. Just as clearly, Kessler is out to humble tobacco, if not destroy it. He's apparently too smart to make his case on the Environmental Protection Agency's fantasy of secondhand smoke, so he says nicotine is'' addictive.'' They mean what the definers want them to mean. The connotation that Kessler is trying to sell is nicotine equals addiction equals heroin and cocaine equals BAD.He gives the game away by his recent approval of nicotine patches for over-the-counter sale.
