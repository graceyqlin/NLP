Article profiles career of tennis player Venus Williams; photo (M) ,"Her father, Richard Williams, touted the match as No. 1 in the world versus No. 1 in'' the ghetto,'' but the real oddity was that Venus had the longer legs of the two. Instead, the elegant Graf won Wednesday's third-round match at the Acura Classic in 81 minutes-- 6- 4, 6- 4-- but imagine if Williams had stopped hitting waist-high to Graf's forehand. I was treating this match like any other match. Like a junior match. Yet, judging from the Graf match, Venus needs a second coach, or at least a new choreographer. Venus has so many more possibilities because of her size.''But Richard Williams will not cave in."

Article discusses expected emphasis on passing for New York Jets offense in 1996; photo (M) ,"Last year the Jets started off with all the makings of a team devoted to a power running game. The team finished last in total offense and last in rushing, averaging 79.9 yards rushing a game. Of the 36 scoring opportunities inside the 20 last season, the Jets scored 17 touchdowns and 10 field goals, and managed just two rushing touchdowns-- the fewest in the National Football League.

The party adopted a platform with amendments that would outlaw abortion, mandate balanced budgets, bar citizenship to American-born children of all illegal immigrants and many legal ones, protect victims' rights and'' safeguard Old Glory.'' But the most disappointing inconstancy came where least expected-- from Jack Kemp. On orders from Mr. Dole, Mr. Kemp decided he was against affirmative action after all. And he decided, against everything he had said and stood for, that children of illegal immigrants should be barred from public school."
"Bob Dole, in speech accepting Republican Presidential nomination, portrayed himself as resolute, Reaganesque father figure and Bill Clinton as leader of communal band of arrogant youth in one of his harshest condemnations of Clinton Administration (M) ","In Bob Dole's acceptance speech tonight, two characters sprang forth larger than life. One was Bob Dole, who emerged gently in the first person singular, a resolute, Reaganesque father figure who could reach back with grace across the rudeness of contemporary life and recreate Norman Rockwell's America. These two characters battled throughout Mr. Dole's speech. If I win,'' he asserted,'' the lives of violent criminals are going to be hell.''The Mr. Dole presented here would be firm where Mr. Clinton has been weak.'' President Clinton has failed to adequately provide for our future defense,'' Mr. Dole said, painting Mr. Clinton as a kind of national deadbeat dad.''"
Editorial lauds Sec of State Warren Christopher for displaying firm diplomacy that will be needed as Bosnia moves toward critical elections (M) ,"In his trip to Geneva and Sarajevo this week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher displayed the kind of firm diplomacy that will be needed as Bosnia moves toward critical elections. These failings have led monitoring groups as well as Bosnian opposition parties to urge that the elections be postponed. Bosnian Serbs agreed to submit a territorial dispute in northeastern Bosnia to binding arbitration. The Dayton agreement promised Bosnia a year's international presence to secure a respite from the fighting and give its people a chance to begin rebuilding a civil society and political institutions. But Dayton can be deemed a success only if the elections are conducted fairly and the new national institutions begin to function."
Bob Herbert Op-Ed column says Bob Dole's promise to enact substantial tax cut and balance budget by 2002 if elected President is not politically possible (M) ,"'' I want a balanced budget by 2002,'' said Bob Dole. I can cut taxes and balance the budget. He said he would'' cut out a few departments'' and'' cut back on a few programs'' and, bingo, the budget would be balanced, even with the half-trillion-dollar Dole-Kemp tax cut. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has just completed an analysis of Mr. Dole's tax cut and budget-balancing plan. That, according to the center's analysis, would push the total spending cuts required between now and 2002 above $ 1 trillion."
Summary of some notable events at Republican National Convention in San Diego (S) ,"DOLE'S RECURRING THEMES On the final night of the Republican National Convention, Bob Dole took center stage with the most important speech of his long political career. The prepared text laid out the Presidential nominee's vision of economic opportunity for all Americans and touched again and again on the issue of trust. WHITMAN Christine Todd Whitman, the New Jersey Governor and co- chairwoman of the convention, is making her own considerable splash at the gathering. So popular is Mrs. Whitman that she had to announce more than once that she was not interested in being Mr. Dole's running mate. She appeared at the convention podium so often that at times it seemed like'' This Week with Christine Whitman.''REPUBLICANS' CREDIBILITY The Republicans certainly did not overdose on truth serum."
Editorial says Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole's acceptance speech at National Convention in San Diego demonstrated both strengths and weaknesses of his candidacy; says Dole faltered in elaborating vision of future (M) ,"Once again, he remained unable to integrate his newly adopted tax-cut plan into his own traditional economic views. It's the economy, stupid,'' Mr. Dole accused the Clinton Administration of advancing materialism at the expense of moral values. His analysis of defense spending, and the claim that President Clinton has failed to'' provide for our future defense,'' was plain dishonest. Mr. Dole even lashed out at Hillary Rodham Clinton's book'' Mr. Kemp has just done an about-face on some of his foundation principles, such as support for affirmative action and defense of the children of illegal immigrants. Dole and Mr. Kemp now have a more energetic aura, and tens of millions of dollars in newly released campaign financing to buy advertisements."
"Colleagues and friends of Republican Presidential nominee Bob Dole say he is man who does not open up easily, if at all; say he is very private person (M) ","they will say that they sat with Bob Dole in the Senate through three Administrations and yet almost never saw him socially.

Russ Townsley, the former editor of The Russell Daily News, Mr. Dole's hometown paper, has known the former Senator since the 1950's. ' I'm sure we'd have more to talk about,'' a former Dole aide said, referring to the President. This is not to say that Mr. Dole is out of touch. Dole's reserve seems perhaps most striking when compared with President Clinton's exceptional garrulousness and easy familiarity."

But it's her hometown and it's totally logical that she should speak.''Because Mrs. Clinton is such a polarizing figure-- both highly popular with core Democratic constituencies and anathema to many moderates-- her role at the convention has been in some doubt for months.

So a Smith photograph that shows the nude torso and legs of a woman striding forward, her arms upraised, echoes a small Smith sculpture beside it. The sculpture was made a decade before the photograph was taken, but that does n't negate the point that Smith instinctively saw the abstraction in the woman's body and saw a body in the abstracted sculpture."

Ms. Molinari's point was that some retirees had their taxes raised by Mr. Clinton and that Mr. Dole would lower them.

These are the facts: The Clinton legislation in 1993 raised taxes by $ 241 billion over five years. In 1982, a bill that was sponsored by Mr. Dole and signed by President Reagan raised taxes by $ 215 billion. But in 1993 dollars, the 1982 tax increase was worth $ 286 billion."

Well, there you have the essence of Mr. Dole's Hollywood problem. The campaign film was certainly full of wholesome values. A near-perfect symbol of this made-for-television convention, the Dole film had high production values, warm and fuzzy stories, and a tired air of deja vu. As he spoke, with the camera in extreme close-up on his face, the film showed black-and-white photographs of his parents.

Parties in lawsuit over pay-per-view broadcasts receive an unusual decision from Judge Nicholas H Politan of Federal District Court; entire four-page decision rejecting bar owners request to dismiss charges of showing boxing match illegally was in rhymes (New Jersey Daily Briefing) (S) ,"The parties in a lawsuit over pay-per-view broadcasts received an unusual decision yesterday from Judge Nicholas H. Politan of Federal District Court: It rhymed. All four pages of it. Judge Politan's ruling rejected a request by Passaic County bar owners to dismiss charges of illegally showing a boxing match. The bar owners cited the refusal by an investigator, Jimmie Mesis, to turn over tapes from his inquiry. The judge rejected that claim in cadences that appeared to have been influenced by the eminent jurist Dr. Seuss.

Gordon Foreman letter comments on Aug 14 Education Page article on disappearance of footnotes from works of nonfiction (S) ,"To the Editor: Footnotes may be disappearing ( Education page, Aug. 14 ), but as on-line publication on the Internet becomes the rule, they are being replaced by'' hot links.'' As a child, on many occasions I spent hours at a stretch lost in the encyclopedia, going from one topic to another as fancy took me. Now I find that hot links offer the same time-absorbing fascination. As scholars attempt to reach a wider audience, the Internet is becoming the medium of choice for publication in most cases, and hot links are filling the role of footnotes far better than footnotes ever did.

Bruce Joshua Miller letter comments on Aug 14 Education Page article on disappearance of footnotes from serious works of nonfiction (S) ,"When on rare occasion I hear a marketing manager or an editor say that a particular book will have few footnotes or no footnotes, as if this were a plus, I bite my tongue. For the last 20 or 30 years footnotes have been placed in the back of the book, not at the bottom of each page. It is silly to think that a book will find a wider audience because it has no footnotes, bibliography or index. The footnote may refer to an obscure and crumbling parchment, to a television broadcast or to a book, but whatever the source of information, the reader has a right to know."
Dr Charles A Derrow letter disputes Bob Herbert's Aug 9 Op-Ed article on managed care (S) ,"This was a routine general surgical procedure. Patients who undergo routine general surgical procedures are almost always discharged on the day they eat their first normal meal successfully and are no longer dependent upon skilled nursing care or intravenous support. Concurrent utilization review is a more efficient and humane way of managing this than retrospective review. I have practiced general internal medicine and geriatric medicine for 19 years. Although traditional fee-for-service medicine has dominated my practice, I have found it no less intrusive than to do what passes for managed care in Columbus, Ohio. Inappropriate utilization management exists in greater number in fee-for-service medicine, where the incentives are to provide more services than necessary. Managed care provides the most hospitable environment in which physicians can do their best work."
Sheldon Weinhaus letter disputes Bob Herbert's Aug 9 Op-Ed article on managed care; drawing (S) ,"Through interpretations of Federal legislation, health maintenance organizations and insurance companies have been allowed deliberately to delay approval of lifesaving medical procedures until after severe deterioration had taken place in the patient's life. Two cases that quickly come to mind are Kuhl v. Lincoln National Health Plan of Kansas City in the Eighth Circuit ( delay in approval of coronary bypass ), and Cannon v. Group Health Service of Oklahoma in the 10th Circuit ( delay in approval of high-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer).In each case the patient died without getting the necessary treatment because the insurer delayed approval. Under Federal legislation the patient's deterioration and the ensuing death assures that the health maintenance organization would never have to pay for this treatment even if it turns out to be covered."

Dr Michael F Montijo letter disputes Bob Herbert's Aug 9 Op-Ed column on managed care (S) ,"Herbert ignores the fact that all the parties involved in the case he writes about, involving a woman admitted to a Long Island hospital for a hysterectomy-- the doctor, the patient and the hospital-- were told one month before the surgery that a three-day, two-night hospital stay had been approved. Furthermore, if there had been complications or abnormalities after the surgery indicating a longer hospital stay was warranted, we would have routinely approved it. Herbert refers to our concurrent review program as a way to make sure patients do n't get too much care. This notion belies the fact that it is in our best interest not to discharge a person from the hospital before he or she is ready to go home."

Robert N Matuozzi letter comments on tragedy of burned ruins of Bosnia's National Library (Aug 12 article) ,"To the Editor: Your account of the burned ruins of Bosnia's National Library ( Sarajevo Journal, Aug. 12 ) points to a lasting consequence of war: the irretrievable destruction of cultural artifacts and distinctive architectural monuments. The destruction of libraries as a feature of warfare has occurred throughout Western history. In his war with Pompey in 47 B.C., Julius Caesar inadvertently burned a large number of books from the Alexandrian Library. Their destruction means the potential loss of information and the loss of those qualities that constitute part of their material and cultural value. Digitizing and duplicating archival materials can not replace the unique qualities of original documents. The project to restore Bosnian materials is a laudable effort to make the National Library of Bosnia a vital working resource for researchers."

If the law applies, the tribe may intervene in the state court proceeding. If the case remains in state court, the tribe may seek to apply the placement preferences in the law ( extended family, tribal members and other Indian families, in that order ), but the state court may place a child outside the preferences if it finds good cause to do so. The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted in response to a tragedy. The act formalized the authority of tribes in the child welfare process in order to protect Indian children and provided procedural protections to families to prevent arbitrary removals and placements of Indian children."

Prof Alan Brinkley article defends Federal power in face of proposed constitutional amendments and laws to radically reshape Government; holds Federal Government is already badly crippled; drawing (M) ,"Washington manages very few programs directly: almost everything it finances is administered to some degree by other levels of government, usually according to guidelines established by Congress or the Federal agencies. The Supreme Court has already edged toward restoring long-repudiated limitations on the ability of the Federal Government to act. But reducing the power of Government is not by itself a route to empowering ordinary citizens. Modern society has many centers of concentrated power, of which the Government is only one and not always the most important. Far from restoring power to individuals, disempowering the Federal Government will do precisely the opposite."

Michael Lewis article discusses why key figures in big Wall Street firms no longer hold public interest in the way they did when Tom Wolfe made a bond salesman the protagonist of The Bonfire of the Vanities; drawing (M) ,"What rings false in 1996 is the character of Sherman McCoy, the Wall Street bond salesman at the center of the novel. Bond salesmen still exist. The trouble with this theory is that the average bond salesman admired Sherman McCoy. Wall Street people no longer buy and dismantle large public corporations, because the prices of these corporations-- as reflected by high stock prices-- have risen exorbitantly. The real money is once again in the democratic stock market rather than the royalist bond market. Thus the most remarkable event in finance over the past six months was the mini-collapse triggered by the self-employed stock market guru Elaine Garzarelli.

"Co-op and condominium boards seek to reduce legal costs, which are largely related to litigation; the easiest way for cooperatives to do this is to weed out litigious shareholders during the admission process; another course is to use arbitration and mediation; cartoon (M) ","With hourly rates ranging from $ 250 to $ 400 for an experienced trial lawyer, litigation can quickly become a black hole for shareholder dollars. The shareholder then goes on the defensive and gets angry at the board. When litigation is unavoidable, co- op and condominium boards can avoid legal fees by carrying adequate insurance coverage. Richard Siegler, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that a standard liability policy in tandem with directors' and officers' coverage will provide a legal defense for a co-op or condominium association or board member named as a defendant in a lawsuit.

The series features music written by composers associated with the cathedral, including Jonathan Bat tishill, an 18th-century chorister at St. Paul's whose affection for alcohol kept him from becoming resident organist there, and John Stainer, a purveyor of Victorian slush as a composer but a fine organist who had a salutary effect on the standard of performance at St. Paul's."

David Bouchier essay on Long Island's highways; drawing (M) ,"THE history of Long Island since the 1930's has been one long road expansion program. The Long Island Expressway and the Northern and Southern State Parkways filled up with traffic the moment they were opened. Most highways in America are designed to go somewhere. At the end of the new highway, drivers will have to choose between taking William Floyd Parkway, which also goes nowhere, or being stuck in a traffic jam on a two-lane highway that heads out east to nowhere. Out west, vast highways going nowhere are a matter of local pride. Long Island is dotted with odd fragments of highways going nowhere. So road building on Long Island is rapidly becoming a zero-sum game. This is clearly the solution for Long Island."

"William Zimmer reviews exhibit of photographs by Eleanor Parke Custis at Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Conn; photos (M)x ","Eleanor Parke Custis ( 1897- 1983 ) was once a well-known photographer. Viewers are struck at the outset by the rich look of her pictures. Custis employed what is called the'' bromoil process,'' developed in 1907. What results in Custis's work is that her whites ( and there are abundant white sails in the Gloucester series ) are whiter than white and the blacks are very opulent. The contemporary she's most in line with is Charles Sheeler, who was both a photographer and a leading Precisionist painter. If Eleanor Parke Custis is insufficiently known, the same surely ca n't be said of Jean-Michel Basquiat ( 1961- 1988 ).

THE BERLIN Philharmonic players respond magnificently to Mr. Levine's almost narrative reading. Mr. Levine makes this music sound both ingeniously compositional and discombobulating.

Lily has left Kate, her only real friend since childhood, with whom she shares an almost erotic closeness; she has also left Turner, the college all three attend and her home in Colorado.

That Lily has lost her own mother and been abandoned by her father lends this insight real poignancy; that she is teaching orphans and contempIating giving up her own child makes it especially piercing.

Letter by Marisa Januzzi scores Nicholas Fox Weber's July 28 review of book Becoming Modern: The Life of Mina Loy by Carolyn Burke ,"Loy's 1923 poetry collection,'' Lunar Baedecker,'' attests to its author's amazing esthetic itinerary. Loy wrote her way out of The Yellow Book and the Pre-Raphaelite influences prevalent during her London childhood, and into the annals of the international avant-garde. During the teens and 20's, her poems and portraits were solicited by nearly every important American little magazine; figures as diverse as Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Djuna Barnes, William Carlos Williams, Basil Bunting, Marcel Duchamp and Thomas Merton acknowledged debts to her. Had Loy merely been the author of a slim Baedeker of the avant-garde, she would still be a pivotal figure whose rediscovery should prompt reconsideration of our narratives of cultural history."

Rebecca Boggs Roberts reviews book The Third Sister: A Continuation of Jane Austen's 'Sense and Sensibility' by Julia Barrett; drawing (M) ,"And then there is the challenge of finding enough loose ends for another story within the neat bundles of marital bliss in which Austen ties up her plots.

Ms. Barrett contemplates no such blasphemy. Instead, Elinor and Marianne remain where they belong- in wedded bliss, in bit parts. Fans of the original novel will enjoy juicy cameo appearances by such favorites as Mrs. Ferrars and the former Lucy Steele. They'll also enjoy a good new story, tight writing and a heroine with brains and charm."

His table of contents resembles a college catalogue, with sections on the physical sciences, the social sciences, mathematics, the arts, philosophy and religion. Miraculously, his ambition does not exceed his erudition; the same reasonable, trustworthy voice examines artificial intelligence and'' Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' pragmatist philosophy and supply-side economics. Mr. Gardner acts as a journalist of ideas, absorbing the most difficult theories of quantum physics and philosophy and restating them for us in jargon-free language. His essays, collected mainly from Scientific American and The New York Review of Books, exhibit a singular love of discovery; he appears impatient to learn what new truths science may uncover. He takes special glee in chiding intellectuals who abandon their common sense."

Prof Kathleen M Sullivan article defends Federal power in face of proposed constitutional amendments and laws to radically reshape United States Government and empower states; drawing (M) ,"Current critics of the Federal Government suggest that it no longer fits Madison's ideal. Thus, contend those in favor of less government, there is no reason today to suppose that the problem of faction is better solved by the Federal Government than by the states. While forgetting these lessons of history, today's critics of the Federal Government also romanticize the states as the body of government closest to the people. Transferring power to the states might well reduce the role of government altogether. State governments are weaker than Congress. Most states have part-time legislatures. Today's constitutional revisionists contemplate disempowering the Federal Government and empowering the very local forces that Madison and the framers most feared."

I learned how to buy them in several languages, what to expect to pay in various countries, and what other brands have to offer ( for better or worse).Since I was traveling alone most of the time, smoking became a way to meet people-- either through asking someone for a light or to share their pack with me.

How to use fluorescent lighting and diagnose problems described; diagrams (M) ,"A fluorescent tube differs from an incandescent bulb in structure and in the way it produces light. Besides the tube, fluorescent fixtures had two other components: a ballast unit and a starter. The current must now arc across the cathodes to complete the circuit, and the entire tube lights up. This switch shuts off the power to the ballast whenever the tube is removed. In the rapid-start fixture, the ballast provides an initial low-voltage current that quickly warms the cathode. Unlike instant-start units, the rapid-starts units use the standard double-pin tubes. Sometimes a problem may be with the tube. Sometimes the tube ends emit an orange glow. The warm-up phase and accompanying orange glow should shut down when the tube lights up. For low-temperature environments, you can purchase special low-temperature tubes and ballasts."

More than 100 years ago, the illustrator Charles Dana Gibson created the Gibson Girl, inspired by his wife, Irene Langhorne, wearing a starched shirt and a linen skirt. The image created a fashion revolution that swept the country and mirrored the American woman's liberation from centuries of fashion bondage. At midcentury, when Dior's corseted 1947 New Look tried to return women to a pedestal, many young women ignored the dictate and invaded Brooks Brothers to buy inexpensive, well-made cotton shirts.

"New York Giants co-owners Wellington Mara and Bob Tisch weigh future of Tommy Maddox, struggling backup quarterback favored by coach Dan Reeves; are expected to ask Reeves to cut Maddox (M) ","It was thought that an act of Congress or the Marine Corps would be about the only things that could separate Giants Coach Dan Reeves from Tommy Maddox, the backup quarterback. The Maddox situation, which has recently turned messy, has definitely caught the attention of ownership. Maddox is capable of playing in the National Football League, but maybe not in New York. In any case, it seems that things somehow go wrong when Maddox is in the game. Reeves is too close to Maddox-- and also too stubborn-- to see these things clearly.
