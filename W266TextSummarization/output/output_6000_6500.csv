The show, which runs through Feb. 16, includes examples of corporate identity design on which companies like FedEx, Continental Airlines and Time Warner have spent millions of dollars. Graphic design is a difficult subject for museums. One of the key roles that graphic design plays is to give a business, an institution or even a person a visual identity. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN concocting a corporate identity was a near-heroic activity. His firm is credited with inventing corporate identity consulting-- and replacing those design wizards with a less flamboyant service-oriented approach. The new identity accepts what people call the company. Michael Strassburger, of the Seattle graphic design firm Modern Dog, probably represents the ultimate in loosely constructed identity."

Leading commercial contenders will include new releases this fall by R.E.M., Counting Crows and Sheryl Crow, with more folk rock from John Mellencamp, Suzanne Vega and Michelle Shocked.

The new station was developed as a joint venture between the town and the railroad, and the town had a say in the warmly colored, almost Southwestern look of the architecture.

A Musical Vaudeville.'' The two shows eyed each other across Broadway in 1975. That's show biz, kid.'' The sentimental and the hard-boiled, which work together in American musical comedy at its best, separate out very clearly in these two works. Many times, the answer is provided in a moralizing, chorus-augmented song that seems tacked on to the surface of the show. It is simply and defiantly about itself. The very limitations of the evening underscored the theme that putting on a good show is what ultimately counts. It's exciting to hear that this cast will be with the show when it opens."
Lawrence B Johnson comment on home audio systems sees resurgence of hi-fi values and what might be called new seriousness in presentation of multi-channel sound for the home; discusses developments in home-theater speaker systems (M) ,"It's surely safe to say that home theater is maturing, and that the first beneficiary is the quality of sound. Certainly among high-end consumers, there's a new realization that the home theater sound system is still the family stereo. One sure sign of home theater's sonic evolution lies in the digital surround-sound hookups to be introduced in new receivers. Digital surround sound takes conventional Dolby Surround to a new level of precision. In the new digital surround sound, all five channels are recorded and reproduced independently. The coming months should also bring a head-to-head battle between high-profile Dolby Digital surround sound and the fledgling-- though seemingly elegant-- consumer version from DTS Technology. And beyond doubt, multichannel sound is the future of audio."

"Max Frankel Word &amp; Image column says money governs American politics, and high cost of television ads is largely to blame; says publicizing donors of big gifts, and setting legal limits, have been tried and have failed, because such restrictions can be easily evaded; says only answer is to demand some free or low-cost television time in every election season, in return for air and cable rights that society grants to television all year long (M) ","IF THERE WAS EVER any doubt, the coming flood of television commercials will remind us: money governs our politics, and the high cost of those TV ads is largely to blame. Or you can reduce the costs of TV time. Spending limits are easily evaded by shifting costs to political parties and other patrons. Limits on contributions are easily evaded by channeling gifts through political action committees and to parties, foundations and assorted ad hoc committees. The only hope lies in greatly reducing the costs of television time-- not for more 30-second attack ads but for the fair and ample exposure of the candidates. That time should be set aside for personal appearances by all legitimate candidates who forgo purchasing commercial spots. It will work against attack ads."

To the brain, everything ultimately ends up as chemicals.

It is always risky to make generalizations about the brain. The other neurotransmitter, noradrenaline, works as a danger signal, preparing the brain and body to fight for survival. Too much stress early in life can permanently alter the genetic machinery of brain cells, reprogramming them to churn out skewed amounts of neurotransmitters."

Mr. Darman leads the reader to believe that the politics of the sensible center represent the historical resolution of the current extremes. The implication is that the sensible center is the historical center. Mr. Darman is certainly right about the gap between the sensible and popular centers.

New Jersey's public and private schools spent an average of $ 70.67 on textbooks, compared with $ 41.90 nationwide, the association found. In 20 states, textbook adoption commitees made up of education officials, teachers and college professors select books for the entire state. Most schools appoint committees of teachers, representing different subjects and grade levels, who examine textbook samples at education conventions and regional book fairs. The textbook is pretty much a necessity.''Mr. Bennetta ventured that most teachers, not just new ones, do n't have enough expertise in their subject to discard their textbooks."

"Historical controversy over tall buildings in New York City discussed in light of Landmarks Preservation Commission's designation this summer of 1915 Equitable Building as official city landmark; building caused considerable controversy at time because of its size, but is now overshadowed by neighbors; photos (L) ","But this summer the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the 1915 Equitable Building, at 120 Broadway, an official city landmark. But it remained in its squat six-story office building on Broadway between Cedar and Pine Streets. Built in 1870 and the first office building to have elevators, the original Equitable Building was by the 1880's two architectural generations out of date. Equitable's hand was forced in January 1912 when a fire destroyed its old building. The vernacular tradition in New York is that the Equitable Building suddenly sparked the 1916 law, as if city planners were startled by it on a stroll down Broadway. In designating the Equitable Building, the landmarks commission took note of its controversial size but described it as'' elegant... one of the finest office buildings of the era.''"

Lindbergh. On Saturday, HBO will begin showing a new movie based on Mr. Kennedy's book, which was recently reissued by Penguin under the title'' Crime of the Century.''''The whole case hinged on the reason why Hauptmann hid the Lindbergh ransom money,'' Mr. Kennedy said.

"County Asphalt head John T Cooney Jr and owners of other businesses along Hudson River battle Tarrytown, NY, proposal to rezone waterfront for marinas and quaint shops and curb growth of existing industries; warn of widespread business failures and closings; photo (M) ","The problem is that when village leaders look ahead, they have a different vision for the waterfront. Instead of factories, they see quaint restaurants and small shops. Under the village's proposed zoning plan, existing industries like County Asphalt would become nonconforming, and plans for their growth would be subject to strict review. Adding to Mr. Cooney's fury is the village's more than two-year delay on his proposal to build a concrete recycling plant on vacant waterfront property that he owns. Nine others along the river are similarly incensed and have joined him to form the Coalition for Sensible Waterfront Development. Jeffers, however, likened village leaders to zealots, saying they were only viewing waterfront development from a single point of view and had'' closed off the conversation'' with the business owners."

In our society, we have talked a lot about what the responsibility of the business is to the community. What we need to start talking about is what the responsibility of the community is to business.

It is bad policy to punish people for joblessness while offering them no possibility of employment. Merely being born poor has become so stigmatized as to be virtually criminal. I do not fear that Wilson's common-sense proposals would not work. I do fear that many of us simply do not care enough to demand that our Government take expedient measures to halt the decay of the inner cities.

Letter from William E Murray Jr on William Julius Wilson's Aug 18 article on lack of jobs for inner city black youth (S) ,"The strictures of political correctness at Harvard probably prohibited Wilson from a more incisive discussion of the unfortunate state of the job market for black ghetto dwellers. Thanks to three decades of more-or-less open-door immigration policy, the market for low-skilled labor is greatly oversupplied. As Wilson notes, employers seem to prefer to hire immigrants first, native blacks last. What the Woodlawn ghetto dwellers really need is a tighter labor market, at which point more would be absorbed into the work force. This, however, means greatly reduced immigration. Judging by the fate of the recent Simpson-Smith immigration bills, this is not going to happen anymore than the expensive remedial programs suggested by Wilson in his article. It is unfortunate that he wasted this opportunity to frame the key issue: oversupply that differentially disfavors blacks."

Liz Price letter contends Nancy Friday 'missed the boat' in her Aug 18 review of Welcome to the Dollhouse ,"('' These Ugly Ducks Swim in a Shallow Pond,'' Aug. 18 $ ). It could n't possibly have been the one where each character, hurt and stomped on by others, in turn lashes out at those who are weaker still, as when Dawn uses derogatory epithets against her one true friend, Ralphie. The beauty of this film lies in its ability to so perceptively capture the bleakness of junior high school, where lost souls like Dawn circle endlessly within the vortex of ruthless peers and clueless, if not outright cruel, parents. Rather, it leaves the audience with compassion for Dawn as the exaggerated embodiment of every awkward adolescent struggling to climb out of the social quicksand of the teen-age years."

Not this or any other definition of'' ugly'' could possibly describe Toni Collette's character. Ms. Collette, as Muriel, may have carried a few pounds more than the standard ideal. But her character, at the very worst, was withdrawn and sullen. The accompanying photograph of Ms. Collette as a bride tells it all.

While the live-action films of previous decades may have been more sensitive, physical stereotyping is an old Disney tradition. The Little Mermaid'' is overweight, the evil lion in'' The Lion King'' has a scarred face. Paradoxically, the Disney films that purport to celebrate the inner beauty of disfigured people are the most hypocritical. The Beast, after all, does n't marry Belle until he turns into a generic handsome young man. These films uncomfortably reflect how our culture's superficial political correctness toward the disabled is merely a mask for our cruel idolization of physical perfection. JENDI B.

Further, the qawwali has been secularized in India and is sung in popular music in the form of ecstatic romantic songs. Khan is also a supreme Punjabi folk singer. Actually, Mr. Khan breaches boundaries separating'' high'' ( classical ) and'' low'' ( folk/ pop ) art forms, classical ( Hindi, Urdu ) and vernacular ( Punjabi ) Indo-Pakistani languages."

"Restoration of Federal tax on domestic airline tickets, and effect on prices, noted (S) ","Air fares change often, but rarely quite so rapidly as they did late last month when the Federal Government started collecting a 10 percent ticket tax on domestic fares, a tax that Congress let lapse at the beginning of the year. After the tax went into effect on Aug. 27, some airlines, including United and American, raised fares 10 percent to account for the tax, which is typically included in quoted fares. Northwest Airlines, for example, said it would raise its fares only about 2.5 percent and absorb the balance of the tax. Generally, airlines match one another's fares on competing routes. And so, by the end of the first day of the new tax, United and others had lowered their fares, indicating they would match other airlines."

Nadler's letter,'' Singapore Subway'' ( July 14 ), described an unpleasant experience in the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit system, saying he and his wife were threatened with arrest for loitering. There is a travel-time limit on the Singapore system that varies with the value of the ticket. An administrative fee of 2 Singapore dollars ( about $ 2.70 ) is imposed on travel beyond that time.

By Candace Gingrich with Chris Bull. New York: Candace Gingrich was indeed an accidental activist, coaxed into the limelight by the political ascendancy of her Big Half Brother Newt. When the 1994 Republican Congressional sweep insured Newt Gingrich's elevation to House Speaker, it was perhaps inevitable that his lesbian little sister receive her 15 minutes of fame. Part of the credit goes to the Human Rights Campaign Fund, which hired her as a full-time traveling spokesman for gay rights. She has little new to say about sexual identity or politics, little new to say even about her famous half brother, 24 years her senior, who remains so remote that she has to depend upon the public record for basic information about him."

Throughout'' Omens of Millennium,'' he consistently draws a distinction between Gnosticism, the religion of secret knowledge, and gnosis, the secret knowledge itself. Analyzing the relationship between millenarianism and Gnosticism, Mr. Bloom has written three books in one: a history of ideas, a religious-cultural critique and a spiritual autobiography. In Gnostic mythology, God, self and world are a single reality; theology, psychology and cosmology are, therefore, different forms of a single truth.

Look between the joists for insulating materials; these may be in the form of insulation batts or loose fill. Evaluating the insulation in the walls is difficult because it's sealed behind the wallboard. Many building codes require that under-floor insulation be covered with gypsum wallboard. If the basement has finished walls, use the same wall-inspection techniques described above to detect the insulation. The crawl space may have insulation blankets spread between the joists. This can be helpful even for homeowners with up-to-date insulation."

"NY Waterway, under pressure from commuters, has resumed its ferry service to midtown Manhattan from Hunters Point during rush hours; ferry line says Hunters Point route is only one of its seven losing money; photo (M) ","Under pressure from commuters, NY Waterway has resumed its ferry service to midtown from Hunters Point during the morning and evening rush hours. The ferry line said last month that the Hunters Point route was the only one of its seven losing money; it announced plans to suspend service. The ferry terminal at Borden Avenue and Second Street opened in October 1994. NY Waterway officials chose the spot on the assumption that the huge Queens West residential development and the renovation of the Long Island Rail Road station at Hunters Point would attract riders. Mr. Smith said that while the ferry's six other routes averaged 2,000 to 3,000 riders daily, only about 500 riders per day used the Hunters Point terminal."

Photos of women wearing black clothing as summer draws to close in New York ,"From the Hamptons to Manhattan, many women welcomed the Labor Day week by packing up their light summer colors and putting on their inky all-black outfits. While fashion rules and designer dictates were abandoned decades ago, a psychological fashion change to dark colors continues to take place for women when September rolls along. Just about anything goes, so long as it's all black. For instance, at the Hampton Classic Horse Show ( three photos on right ), the outfits du jour were dark pants suits, dark dress and dark sports-wear separates. In Manhattan, daytime was for a Gucci T-shirt and trousers, and ankle-length dresses, including one woman out for an afternoon of shopping in a dark lace dress. Remember, there are no fashion rules.

Hope Ryden letter explains New York State's beaver counts (S) ,"To the Editor: They count beavers in rural New York State, do n't they ( news article, Sept. 3 )? The state leaves room for error by making aerial counts of beaver lodges and multiplying this number by an estimate of how many beavers each lodge ought to contain. Most beaver lodges are unoccupied. My Lily Pond colony-- actually one beaver-- has built or repaired four lodges this year. In fact, the highest number of beavers to winter on Lily Pond was eight in 1986. And the life span of a wild beaver is short. this suggests that unmanaged beaver populations may regulate their numbers cyclically in response to natural factors. By contrast, beavers that are heavily trapped and overmanaged may compensate for steady losses with high birth rates."

Timmerman suggests ( Op-Ed, Sept. 4 ), the State Department risks a growing number of foreign policy failures by ignoring ethnic groups, like the Kurds, who have no political state. The carnage in Bosnia escalated because of the United States failure to recognize the significance of nations inside Yugoslavia. United States military personnel are now in Bosnia because of the early failures under President Bush's State Department. Only when one senior State Department official showed a flare for creative diplomacy did the war caused by big-power failures come to an end."

No doubt Mr. Kohl realized that Nov. 9 is the anniversary of Kristallnacht, as Mr. Brau notes, but also of Hitler's 1923 Munich beer hall putsch. Kristallnacht happened on Nov. 9 not only by coincidence but also because the Nazi cohort of drunken goons had gathered across the Reich to commemorate the failed 1923 assault on German democracy. Far from a date to celebrate, Nov. 9 should be a day for Germans to reflect on Nazi crimes and the fragile character of democratic institutions. JEROME M. GARCHICKSan Francisco, Sept. 5, 1996"

Advice on negotiating best mortgage deal with banks and finance companies; warns of little-known practice of mortgage brokers and bank loan officers of bumping up interest rates or points and pocketing the difference; lawsuit filed by Richmond homeowners Mary and Earl Ransom against broker who overcharged them on refinancing discussed; photo (S) ,"The suit, filed in 1994 against Crosstate and Fleet Finance, is one of a number of class actions focusing on a little-known practice of mortgage brokers and bank loan officers: bumping up the interest rate or points so they can pocket the difference. Or maybe 8.5 percent interest, or both. Each extra point the broker or loan officer can coax a borrower to pay could mean more money to him. Then they should have the broker outline all the charges, from points to appraisal fees. Or, those points can be kept by the broker, as a reward for getting the bank a higher interest rate. Guttentag said brokers usually try to get an amount equal to 1.5 percent of the loan for themselves, either from the borrower or the lender."

Guidance on investing in behemoth companies according to dividend yield; analyst Melissa R Brown discusses her finding that 'huge cap' stocks with highest yields easily bested stocks with little or no yield; graph of top dividend yielders aong 50 biggest US corporations (S) ,"The 10 or so highest yielders had an average return of 15.3 percent annually, the lowest yielders gained 10 percent and stocks with no yield returned just 3.1 percent. The dividend yield, which represents a company's annual dividend as a percentage of its stock price, was'' the best indicator of the three,'' she said. Also, some of the Dow stocks may be riskier investments. Since dividends tend to be steady, the reason for a high yield is often a low stock price that reflects-- perhaps validly-- the market's low opinion. ( None of these stocks rival the electric utilities, like Boston Edison, which yields 8.1 percent.)Among the 10 companies, the highest-yielding is Philip Morris."

"Agriculture experts say New Jersey crops had slow start this year because of cool, wet July; but if warm days with little rain continue, most may catch up before the end of the season (S) ","New Jersey crops had a slow start this year because of the cool, wet July. But the State Agriculture Department already sees some trends. The wet weather has reduced the quality of tomatoes but helped the flavor the corn, said Stephen Garrison of the Rutgers University Cooperative Extension Service. This year's pepper crop was substantially reduced, and anything growing near the ground, like squash, pumpkins and cucumbers, will produce less than farmers had hoped because ground moisture rots the vegetables, said Phil Traino, secretary of the state Vegetable Growers Association. Farmers also had to use more fungicides on crops than usual, the Agriculture Department said."

Stern have embraced the shortsighted committee of citizens that is opposed to erecting plaques to commemorate Holocaust victims other than Jews ('' A Rift Opens Over' Other Victims' at Holocaust Memorial,'' Aug. 18).It is fitting to honor all Holocaust victims on a public park memorial. During the Holocaust when six million Jews perished, five million non-Jews were also exterminated. Among these were 500,000 gypsies who, like the Jews, endured racial persecution and were shipped to concentration camps to be tortured and murdered. While the Jews bore the brunt of the Holocaust, it would be unjust to deny other victim groups the remembrance they deserve. It is appropriate that these groups be given plaques on the memorial."

"Editorial warns that Republicans are inserting environmentally destructive provisions into several bills; opposes measure that would permit overgrazing on Western public land; charges Alaska Congressional delegation, which never sleeps, is now trying to extend Ketchikan Pulp Company's exclusive right to clear-cut Tongass National Forest by slipping provision into Omnibus Parks Act; also opposes indefinite extension of rider mandating rapid increase in 'salvage' logging that overrides environmental controls ","The Omnibus Parks Bill, for example, was originally an unobjectionable measure aimed at protecting the historic Presidio military base in San Francisco. Another bill would transfer a Federal wildlife refuge in Oklahoma to state authorities, who are eager to open it for recreational use. If passed, the bill could encourage further efforts to dismantle the refuge system. A bill sponsored by Senator Pete Domenici, undoing these regulations, has already passed the Senate. A version of the Domenici bill is now before the House. Temporarily thwarted in their efforts to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Senator Frank Murkowski and Representative Don Young have introduced bills that would extend for 15 years the Ketchikan Pulp Company's exclusive right to clear-cut Alaska's Tongass National Forest."

The focus of the bill is an independent city authority called the Industrial Development Agency, which floats bonds and grants tax breaks for projects that promote the growth of jobs. But it is irresponsible to grant boroughs the power to award tax breaks that will only worsen the city's huge budget deficits. The city's economic development strategy has to be unified and coordinated in order to work. It's bad enough that City Hall feels it has to fight Stamford or Jersey City over luring businesses to New York."

He has been rightly pressed by Israel and the United states to combat Palestinian terrorist organizations. He is now the architect of repressive policies and conduct that may do lasting harm to his Authority and to the peace effort.

"Disturbance at maximum-security prison, Pontiac, Ill, over crackdown on prisoners' random calls to strangers, often children, willing to accept charges and chat is example of tensions that often arise with cutbacks in prison privileges; cutbacks, spurred either by abuses or by public complaints that prisoners are pampered, can demoralize prisoners and lead to violence (M) ","Prison experts say the uproar illustrates the tensions that often arise with cutbacks of privileges in penitentiaries.

If Mr. Izetbegovic agreed now to allow the expelled to return to their homes, he would accept the division of Bosnia along ethnic lines, a step toward a Muslim state."
Elaine Rosenberg letter comments on Sept 5 article on New York City's business improvement district programs (S) ,"To the Editor: Thank you, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for turning your attention to New York City's business improvement district programs ( news article, Sept. 5 ). I am perplexed by the lack of city control over tax assessment monies given to the districts. The business improvement district for Madison Avenue, which personally concerns me as an art gallery owner, is an oxymoron. Madison Avenue does not have to be improved; the businesses are the improvement. With its international flavor, the avenue is the most elegant of the city. I do not deny that an improvement district may function in other areas, but I question their budgets and excessive executive salaries. ELAINE ROSENBERGNew York, Sept. 5, 1996"
"Op-Ed article by New York State Sen Frank Padavan attributes overcrowding in New York City's schools to huge and continuing increase in population of immigrant students; says Congress should at least recognize its responsibility to provide financial aid to city and handful of other urban centers that have been bearing most of burden of immigration, both legal and illegal (M) ","New York City's students went back to school this week, taking their seats in overcrowded classrooms-- and in closets and locker rooms and spaces carved out of auditoriums. But Congress should at least recognize its responsibility to provide financial aid to New York City and the handful of urban centers that have been bearing most of the burden of immigration, both legal and illegal. The change could have a major impact on New York City's overcrowding, without imposing a significant burden on Federal taxpayers. New York City's members of Congress must recognize that the quality of life enjoyed by the immigrants they represent will be determined by the caliber of their education. Frank Padavan, a Republican, represents northeastern Queens in the New York State Senate."
Anthony Tommasini reviews concert of new music presented by Composers Recordings Inc as part of SoHo Arts Festival (M) ,"In 1952 at the Museum of Modern Art, the composer Otto Luening and his colleague Vladimir Ussachevsky presented the first concert of electronic music on tape in the United States. Like Mr. Luening's pioneering electronic music concert, the SoHo event presented composers who embrace technological innovations in sound. Yet the distinguishing feature of this music was its intentional blurring of traditions: contemporary concert music, rock, funk, jazz. Jack Vees, whose works were performed by Chez Vees ( Mr. Vees on bass guitar, Libby Van Cleve on amplified oboe, Jeffrey Kreiger on electronic cello ), studied composition in California, but his music owes more to his background as a fringe rock bassist."

Mr. Lord writes about Giacometti with unusual sensitivity. And art counts above all else. But when Mr. Lord published a letter in the leftist newspaper Combat denouncing Picasso for his Communist connections, Cocteau came to the artist's defense. And there is the saga of Giacometti's gifts of art to Mr. Lord, made, we are carefully informed, when the artist's disapproving wife, Annette, was not around. He also chastises the people who, partly to ingratiate themselves with her, he says, signed a manifesto denouncing his Giacometti biography."

Jon Pareles reviews performance of music group New Kingdom at Wetlands (S) ,"New Kingdom aimed for overload when it headlined a CMJ Music Marathon hip-hop showcase on Saturday night at Wetlands. New Kingdom's raps are abstract free-associations, jumping from autobiography to reflections on compulsive creativity to fantasies of escaping to other planets; they drop names including Superfly and Paul Bunyan's Babe the Blue Ox. With booming bass lines and volleys of scratching from the disk jockey, feedback or power chords from the guitarist and brawny live drumbeats, New Kingdom's songs were brash and exultant, turning cacophony into jubilation. He speeds up old-school hip-hop, slinging bellicose rhyming insults over a basic beat. Between boasts and taunts, Chino XL also mocked the music business and the shtick of gangster rap and lashed out at the police."

But the most noticeable characteristic of the music, in English or Spanish, is that Ms. Estefan has made a conscious attempt to make it all Afro-Hispanic. At times the music was all drums and voice.

Editorial comments on forest fire in Bighorn Mountains in central Wyoming (S) ,"A small forest fire had been burning for days near Stockwell Creek in the Bighorn Mountains. It was nearly extinguished when the wind blew the fire over Little Goose Peak and onto the steep walls of an adjacent canyon. The doors of the fire station stood open, and there was a puzzling air of expectant idleness about the place, which was resolved the next morning when exhausted fire crews gathered outside the station. Along the east-west face of the Bighorns, the wind sucked the lower edge of the smoke cloud downward, out over the hay meadows and pastures south of town. But soon smoke settled over the canyon again, the heat of the fire, its roar, and now even its light lost in the distance."

Pataki's political calculations are further evidence of the New York Republican Party's change of stance over the last year, political analysts said. He confidently predicted that the bond act would pass in all but 10 of the 50 upstate counties."

Poor defensive play by New York Giants in loss to Dallas Cowboys discussed; photo (M) ,"Tired, yes, and not nearly as effective as it was last week against Buffalo when the defense sacked Jim Kelly seven times. Whenever the Giants blitzed, the Cowboys used what is generally called'' max protection.'' They kept everyone in, including running backs and tight ends, to protect quarterback Troy Aikman. And when the Giants used a defense in which the safety slides over toward the middle of the field, Aikman threw to the spot the safety vacated. Over all, Aikman was hot, throwing perfect passes to Deion Sanders and Kevin Williams for touchdowns of 8 and 19 yards.''"

Not much you can say when you get beat like that,'' said Reeves, who has beaten the Cowboys only once-- in a meaningless season-ending game in 1994-- in three-plus seasons as the Giants' coach.'' The Giants responded well to that first setback. The Giants stopped the Cowboys on the first two series of the second quarter, but the offense could not take advantage.

Thanks to Bill Gates, Basic was the first programming language availbable on the very first personal computer ( the Altair ) in 1975, and it was also one of the first languages available on the I.B.M. personal computer. Historically, the primitve features of the language almost mandated that programmers created convoluted'' spaghetti code'' that no one else could decipher. By the mid-1980's, it was ready to become the most popular programming language for personal computers. In object-oriented programming, objects are reusable computer codes that fuction as the basic building bloks of programs. C++ is currently the language Microsoft encourages for new Windows programs."

This figure is suspect because many travelers are n't flying on business, and many business people make ample use of the half-hour wait working on their laptops, making calls and doing research. Now it costs only $ 250,000 per saved life."
A M Rosenthal Op-Ed column says public and Congress should press Pres Clinton on why Iraq's armies have grown far stronger than when he took office and why Pres Saddam Hussein's prestige in Europe and Middle East are higher than ever (M) ,"Almost four years after President Clinton assumed responsibility for dealing with Iraq, its armies are far stronger than when he took office, its network of arms factories is rebuilt and fully operating, its secret programs for weapons of mass destruction are clicking along, and Saddam Hussein's prestige in the Mideast and even Europe are higher than ever. And it is why the coalition that militarily defeated him in the gulf war is dissolving-- not because Mr. Clinton was trying to destroy Saddam but because he was not. High U.S. officers so advised. These'' leaders'' turned for arms to Iran or Saddam. And why has he not devoted any speeches to Saddam's new programs for nuclear, chemical and bacteriological weapons?"
"Profile of Dr Eric Steven Lander, pioneer in new branch of biology known as genomics; Lander, director of Whitehead Institute/MIT Genomics Center in Cambridge, Mass, is a leader in constructing a complete catalogue of human DNA code or genome; new branch of academic biology is information-heavy, computer-driven and closely allied to business; photo (M) ","Lander, director of the Whitehead Institute / M.I.T. Genome Center here, is a leader in constructing a complete catalogue of the human DNA code or genome. The consortium of laboratories had planned to complete the full DNA sequence of the human genome by the year 2005 at a cost of $ 3 billion, but is already two years ahead of schedule and below budget. For example, Dr. Lander says, biologists may learn to read human DNA so effectively that laboratories will quickly be able to tell patients all the important variations they have in their entire gene set, or genome. If you have 100,000 genes, that means there will only be about 300,000 major variants."
Russel Baker Op-Ed column deplores use of family values as theme in Presidential election by Pres Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole; says government has no business thrashing around in moral quagmire (M) ,"For bad taste it's hard to beat the statesmen Clinton and Dole waxing sentimental over family values. Dole is divorced, and Clinton, as all viewers of'' 60 Minutes'' can attest, is a philanderer. Political campaigns are hard enough to endure as it is, without being catechized by a couple of humdrum sinners like Clinton and Dole on how to put more moral texture into the fabric of family life. The Clinton polls remain unaffected by the Morris farce, suggesting that nobody cares much about this hilarious twist on Clinton's family-values campaign. Are he and Clinton running for Pope? President Clinton's ambitions sound less grandiose than Dole's, but they divert us even further from the realities. The discovery would profit everybody, Clinton most of all."

International Festival of Puppet Theater to open in New York City today and continue for two weeks; 22 puppetry companies will perform at five theaters; festival is sponsored by Jim Henson Foundation; photo (M) ,"Every other year since 1992, the International Festival of Puppet Theater has brought to New York an enticing array of handheld artistry, from puppets on a shoestring to satiric extravaganzas. The first festival, which took place at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, was a tribute to the late Mr. Henson and Mr. Papp. The 1996 festival will mark the New York premiere of'' Peter and Wendy,'' Lee Breuer's retelling of'' Peter Pan'' ( Sept. 18- 22 at the Public Theater ). ( Sept. 18- 21 at the Public Theater ), conceived and performed by the Belgian puppeteer Nicole Mossoux. A lifelike puppet is positioned on Ms. Mossoux's shoulder, and such is the resemblance that it is hard to differentiate between the puppet and the puppeteer."
Article on Canada and Team USA preparing for championship round of World Cup tournament (M) ,"Mark Messier practiced for only about 10 minutes yesterday in Philadelphia, then headed for Team Canada's training room for treatment of sore groin muscles. Wayne Gretzky stayed on ice for the entire workout as his national team prepared to play the United States in the championship round of the World Cup of Hockey. Canada did n't want him for international tournaments, Brett Hull said; the Americans did.''They're still the best team in the world,'' Hull said of Team Canada.'' The United States and Canada played in the championship round then, as well, and Canada won it, two games to none. The American victory over Canada early in this tournament was the first ever at this level of play."

"Dancers from several nations perform in Moves II, program at Merce Cunningham Studio that is produced by Patricia Wolf; photo; Jack Anderson review (S) ","One of them,'' 2 Are 1 ( Dich und Mich ),'' was a sultry duet in which Natalie Agee and Chankoo Paik entwined themselves erotically about each other. Ms. Wolf, who was born in San Francisco of German parents, was at her choreographic best in'' Way,'' a solo in which the deliberate effort Won Kim invested in every step she took implied that she was on a momentous journey. When Ms. Holzhausen, a German choreographer, had the dancers remove their shoes, they no longer clattered when they moved.

"Neil Strauss reviews concert by British band Oasis at Jones Beach; photo of Liam Gallagher, lead singer (M) ","What Oasis has done in Britain, unifying an entire country under the banner of a single pop act, a band could no longer accomplish in a country that has become as culturally splintered as the United States. While the members of Oasis, which performed at Jones Beach on Sunday night, are superstars only to a niche pop audience here, in Britain the band reigns unchallenged as the most popular act since the Beatles. The 17-song show mixed material from the band's two albums with lesser-known B-sides of singles, each of which was catchy enough to be a hit itself. A new song,'' POP REVIEW"
"Stephen Holden comments on original cast albums of musicals Rent and Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk; photos (M) ","The original cast albums of Broadway musicals have always had such a decisive effect on the shows' future reputations that it is easy to fool oneself into believing that a recording, augmented with photographs and descriptive liner notes, can distill the essence of a production. But as the original cast albums of'' Rent'' ( DreamWorks ) and'' Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk'' ( RCA Victor ) ,'' the 1968'' tribal musical'' that yielded pop hits. The difference between the production'' Bring In da Noise'' and its cast album demonstrates the fundamental difficulty of recording a dance-oriented show. Still, the album successfully suggests a continuity among all the score's abrupt changes of style."
Michiko Kakutani reviews Jeffrey Toobin book The Run of His Life: The People v. O J Simpson; photo (M) ,"The People v. O. J. Simpson By Jeffrey Toobin 466 pages. In Mr. Toobin's view, two reasons stand out:'' The prosecution's arrogance led it to disaster. The defense's obsession with race led it to victory.''It is Mr. Toobin's contention that Mr. Simpson's lawyers, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., knew their client was guilty from the start. Mr. Toobin writes that Mr. Shapiro said to friends,'' Of course he did it,'' and that before signing on to the defense team, Mr. Cochran told a friend:'' During jury selection, Mr. Toobin observes, the prosecution did not even exercise all 20 of its peremptory challenges."
"Powerful coalition in Western Europe is coming together to stem spread of shopping malls--coalition that includes small-store owners facing extinction, politicians fearful for the future of town centers, and environmentalists disgusted with the way automobiles chew up the landscape; while American-style suburban malls, like the Marques Avenue outlet in Troyes, France, southeast of Paris, are popular in Western Europe, national governments are bowing to anti-development pressure with laws aimed at curbing their construction; situation in Great Britain, France, Italy and Germany discussed; tables; photos (L) ","Yet within a month, the French Government effectively blocked new out-of-town shopping centers by subjecting the construction of retail space of more than 11,000 square feet-- about the size of a small Gap store-- to central Government approval.'' With customers demanding lower prices and convenient access to stores, suburban shopping now accounts for a large share of retail business in Europe, especially in France. The death of independent retailers is destroying jobs at a rate that the new shopping centers can not offset, he said in an interview.

"Editorial says overcrowding in New York City's public schools is less sudden crisis than long-term failure to provide children with educational basics; urges Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to drop proposal to send 1,000 low-achieving students to Catholic schools, while offering suggestions on possible ways of alleviating problem (M) ","The reports of overcrowding in New York City's public schools last week sounded like a sudden disaster-- classes in locker rooms and projection booths, guidance counselors working in closets, and first grades packed with well over 40 children. The city has known for years that it had too few classrooms and that too many schools were actually losing space because of leaky roofs, crumbling walls and antique heating systems. Then the School Construction Authority was created. The main physical obstacle is air-conditioning the school buildings. The city can also expand school space fairly quickly by renting and renovating neighborhood factories, office buildings and even unused churches. But the Mayor would be better advised to tackle the school facilities problem head on rather than backing unworkable proposals for public funding in the parochial schools."
Editorial urges UN to approve nucleat test ban treaty and US Senate to ratify it after it is signed by Pres Clinton; praises Australia for last-minute diplomatic efforts to win UN approval (M) ,"Australia deserves the world's gratitude for leading a last-minute diplomatic rescue of the nuclear test-ban treaty. The treaty, which is likely to be voted on in the United Nations General Assembly today, can thwart the development of new generations of dangerous weapons, encourage further reductions of nuclear weapons stockpiles and spare the environment the shock of further underground nuclear blasts. All five existing nuclear powers have said they will sign. Even without this monitoring system, the United States is confident it will be able to detect and publicize any nuclear explosions, using its own intelligence resources. These should reasonably be extended to include Chinese, British and French warheads, perhaps starting with confidence-building agreements to take nuclear weapons off their present operational status. Moves of this nature would reasonably respond to India's call for nuclear disarmament."
