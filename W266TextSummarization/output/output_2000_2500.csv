Status of labor negotiations between representatives of baseball players and owners discussed (M) ,"It was not known which elements of the talks any of the owners questioned or had concerns with, but there was one issue on which some owners had a strong view-- service time the players lost in the strike.

Negotiators had not spent much time discussing service time, but the owners' team was well aware of the players' position.

Science question and answer column describes how sand is created; drawing (S) ,"Where does sand come from? Has any thought been given to manufacturing it?A. Particles of sand, sometimes sorted by water transport into deposits of remarkably uniform size, are continually being formed, often from the bedrock of earth, by weathering and erosion by chemical and physical forces. Sand particles may be glued together along with other minerals to form new sedimentary rocks, like the familiar sandstone, and sedimentary rocks may in turn be weathered into new sand. Sand is part way up the scale of particle size, larger than the very fine particles of clay and silt and smaller than gravel and pebbles. One widely used scale, the Wentworth-Udden scale, puts the size of sand particles at approximately 0.0025 inches to 0.08 inches."

Bob Dole's interest in the party platform seems to have extended no further than how it would play in the media.

The people who will nominate Bob Dole Thursday are far more conservative than their party as a whole, let alone the nation. But the people who care about party platforms are exactly the same sort of people who turn out for other low-profile political activities, like nominating school board candidates, electing local party officials and turning out the vote in future Presidential primaries."

Summary of some happenings at Republican National Convention in San Diego (S) ,"Regardless of what its platform says, the Republican Party is striving for a warmer, fuzzier convention. In perhaps the ultimate display of togetherness, Mr. Buchanan yesterday said:'' I endorse the Republican ticket of Dole-Kemp, and will work for a national Republican victory in November.''HIGHLIGHTING A FEW SPLINTER-PROOF PLANKSBob Dole says he has not read it, and some of the convention's star speakers take issue with it. The one adopted yesterday is extremely conservative, moving to the right on social issues like immigration, welfare and gay rights and omitting the word'' tolerance'' in an unbending abortion plank that fueled weeks of bitter intraparty debate. But the party faithful chose to spotlight less divisive planks: economic opportunity, safer streets and better schools. THE REPUBLICANS"

The Home Army received arms and money from the Polish government in exile in London. New evidence uncovered by Yisrael Gutman and Shmuel Krakowski of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem confirms that in 1943 plans were laid by leaders of the Polish underground for the elimination of Jewish survivors after the war.

The very design of their bodies makes them more vulnerable than men to serious knee injuries and chronic knee problems that cause pain and disability. However, when it comes to seeking medical help for a problem like chronic knee pain, women are not much better than men about going to a doctor. This delay can result in a more serious knee problem that involves more extensive treatment and disables them for far longer than it would have if they had sought therapy earlier.

"Study finds likelihood of seriously ill patients' deciding against life-prolonging care is 30% greater for those whose illnesses cause them greater financial hardship, depleting savings or forcing them to postpone education plans for family members; study author, Dr Kenneth E Covinsky, comments (M) ","Linda L. Emanuel, vice president of ethical standards for the American Medical Association, questioned whether financial hardship was what influenced patients to reject life-sustaining care. But the difference was greatest among the patients under 45, with 42 percent of those experiencing economic hardship choosing comfort care, compared with 32 percent of those who were not. Of the patients 85 and older who had financial trouble, 69 percent said they preferred comfort care, as against 62 percent of the others. The goal was to see if the surrogates were more inclined than the patients to want to avoid life-sustaining care if family finances were in jeopardy. In 73 percent of the cases, patients and their surrogates chose the same course of care."

Manafort, Mr. Dole's convention manager, said,'' The convention planners have arranged their schedule to meet the needs of the major broadcast networks, however, because those networks command the largest audiences. CBS and ABC each carried about 35 minutes of the convention planners' program itself, while NBC devoted about 20 percent more time-- 42 minutes-- to it. The networks certainly strayed far enough from the official convention script on occasion to make Republicans grind their teeth. The anchors warned the audience that the planners were trying to script the convention."

"Norbert Walter Op-Ed article says much of debate about US economy during current Presidential campaign is beside point because key assumption, that productivity growth is low, is false; says, compared with counterparts in other parts of world, American workers perform at least as well; says Japan and Germany are more than little envious of output of US workers (M) ","One of the clearest examples of this malaise is the fretting over its supposedly weak productivity growth. Much has been made of the fact that Germany's productivity increased by 3.6 percent in 1994 and 2.2 percent in 1993, while Japan had an annual productivity growth rate of 2.3 percent between 1979 and 1994. To begin with, one needs to be careful not to confuse productivity growth with the overall level of productivity. Productivity growth only tells us about progress made from one year to the next. If with the simple stroke of an economist's pen we removed 6 percent of American workers from the equation, United States productivity growth would be approximately 1.5 percent, about the current rate for Western Europe."
"Editorial, commenting on Turkey's $23 billion gas-pipeline cooperation agreement with Iran, says Clinton Administration needs to be frank in expressing concerns over Turkey's warming of ties with Iran, which it has tried to isolate as dangerous rogue state that sponsors international terrorism (M) ",The $ 23 billion gas pipeline cooperation agreement that Mr. Erbakan signed with Iran this week directly challenges one of the Clinton Administration's central foreign policy goals. President Clinton last week signed into law a bill to impose sanctions on any country making new investments in Iran's energy infrastructure. The Turkish deal represents just such an investment. It is also the largest energy export deal Iran has ever made. The Administration has not yet decided whether the Turkish deal formally violates the new sanctions law. Yet it also talks about arranging barter deals to help Iran build its section of the proposed gas pipeline. Even since signing the Iran deal he says he seeks no conflict with Washington. Neither the army nor Mr. Erbakan's secular coalition partners expressed any public objections to the Iran oil deal.
Editorial says discovery that genetic mutation can protect certain individuals from AIDS virus despite repeated exposure solves puzzling medical mystery and opens new pathways toward treatments and possibly a vaccine (S) ,"The discovery that a genetic mutation can protect certain individuals from the AIDS virus despite repeated exposure solves a puzzling medical mystery and opens new pathways toward treatments and possibly a vaccine. In this case the lucky individuals included two homosexual New Yorkers who had somehow escaped infection with the AIDS virus despite repeated, unprotected sex with companions who died from the disease. Last week scientists at the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City did just that. The two New Yorkers who resisted infection inherited the genetic mutation from both parents. The protective mutation, while not common, is not extremely rare. These new discoveries are a reminder that genetic mutations, though often deemed'' defects,'' can sometimes prove a blessing, conferring surprising benefits on those lucky enough to inherit them."

Never in an American political convention had so many said so little so fast.

Israel Bar-Nir letter disputes Aug 13 article in air travel security (S) ,"To the Editor: Your Aug. 13 front-page article on air travel security overlooks one basic fact that is most probably the real reason for the airlines' grossly negligent attitude. This cap, which stands at $ 75,000, protects the airlines from bearing the full financial burden of any international air disaster like Pan Am Flight 103 or Trans World Airlines Flight 800.In fact, if T.W.A. had to pay only that amount for all passengers killed in this most recent disaster, the sum would be less than the cost of the airplane itself. Another issue is why security should be the responsibility of the airlines. No one would seriously consider assigning the duties of the customs services or the immigration services to the airlines."

Upon finding out I had a computer, the operator seemed happy and let me pass without even looking in my briefcase. This occurred just two weeks after the explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800.Had this occurred in Singapore, I would have been required to turn on the computer to prove that it worked, and my briefcase would have been subject to a search.

Bob Grizzard letter disputes William Shore's Aug 6 Op-Ed article on welfare reform (S) ,"President Clinton betrays no one by signing the welfare bill. The welfare system evolved in an era when women could not legitimately enter the workplace, a time when many men were maimed and lost the ability to work because the workplace was not safe, and they could not then work because of their acquired disability. While the'' good'' choices in welfare reform are not easy to discern, surely one of them is to ask the parents to contribute their work ( if able ) to the support of their children. The welfare bill is far from perfect, but in all the circumstances, it is the best we can now achieve. Bill Clinton is not perfect either, but he is good."

To further diminish their small store of hope and belief in their fellow mortal creatures' basic decency is a heinous thing to do. Christmas Eve 1992 I worked at a temporary shelter for the homeless in San Diego ( that now seems ironic ), dispensing woolen socks. I handed them a measly pair of socks, and they thanked me and thanked me and said,'' God bless you.'' And surely there is a right way and a wrong way to do it."
Rachelle Marshall disputes William Shore Aug 12 Op-Ed article deploring welfare-reform legislation passed by Congress (S) ,"I consider President Clinton's willingness to sign a bill that virtually repeals welfare a failure of courage and a betrayal of liberalism. Surely children who will suffer as a result of the new welfare bill will be no better off if the Republicans who designed it control both Congress and the Presidency. What purists forget is that voting is not a matter of selecting or rejecting an ideal leader but of choosing between relative evils. There are many ways of translating moral conviction into practice, as Mr. Shore has demonstrated by working for disadvantaged children, but to do so by refusing to vote for a flawed but demonstrably better candidate indicates a misunderstanding of our political system, and is futile besides."

The temperature reached 106 degrees that day, and water bottles did not carry enough water or keep it cool. Reaching for a water bottle while pedaling among other riders sometimes meant veering into another cyclist. They are simple in design: a soft plastic bladder filled with water and ice fits inside an insulated nylon carrier, which is strapped on the back or around the waist. Adjustable straps keep the water packs comfortably in place. Experts in sports medicine say 6 to 8 ounces of water should be drunk every 15 minutes during vigorous exercise to avoid dehydration.

The reason it did so is clear: The shuttle is a manned space program whereas most scientific space missions are not. Just why manned space programs are politically preferable to unmanned ones is not so clear. Whatever the reason, the result is the same: the great question posed by the meteorite found on the Antarctic ice would have been answered years ago but for NASA's shuttle policy. We must first wind up the shuttle program without delay. Second, dump the even more expensive and useless space station boondoggle. Finally, forget about imbecilic schemes, like the one now enshrined in the 1996 Republican platform, for manned missions to Mars."
John Moynihan letter disputes Russell Baker's Aug 13 Op-Ed column on Achilles as first yuppie (S) ,"To the Editor: With all due respect to Russell Baker in his attempt to put a modern spin on Homer's'' Iliad'' ( column, Aug. 13 ), he misinterprets the character of the pivotal figure in the development of Western philosophy. Achilles' refusal to fight on behalf of the Greeks is a reaction to the hypocrisy of Agamemnon; Agamemnon forced Achilles to surrender the woman he loved, in contradiction to the whole point of the Trojan War. In the proto-classical Greek of the sixth and seventh centuries, the traditional dates for the composition of'' The Iliad,'' there were literally no words for right and wrong in an ethical sense. Lacking the vocabulary to express his newly divined sense of morality, Achilles could only sit out the fighting in protest."

But after I read your Aug. 8 news article in which the Egyptian author Nawal Saadawy pointed out that at least 40,000 girls in the United States are subjected to that torture, I am of the opinion that even otherwise educated people in advanced society are just as likely to commit this crime. The United States would have to move beyond educating immigrant parents about the consequences of female genital mutilation and make it a Federal crime. It dates to the era when girls were chattel sold to potential husbands who paid premium price for virgins."

There is a whole list of potential challengers, starting with those who, unlike Mr. Kemp, tried for the Presidential nomination in 1996 and failed. Next time, he said at a consolation rally last weekend, the Buchanan brigades would name the candidate, too. This convention probably marked the end of Presidential ambitions for some."

Max Lowenthal letter disputes recent reports of evidence suggesting existence of life on Mars (S) ,"To the Editor: As a layman utterly unequipped to evaluate the scientific fine points, I have no hesitancy in declaring that the'' discovery'' of evidence suggesting that there might have been life on Mars eons ago is piffle that will soon be ranked with cold fusion and the luminiferous ether. Of course we can not say it is impossible that something like life as we know it exists or has existed elsewhere in the universe; what we can say is that the thought strains credulity. The Big Bang theory is the pre-eminent example of this; a mere moment's reflection establishes that while this galaxy or googolplex galaxies may have sprung from a big bang, the idea that the universe had a beginning is nonsensical."
Norman Grant letter comments on Aug 13 Science Times article on search for life on Mars (S) ,"To the Editor: For perhaps a century scientists speculated that preconditions for life to arise in the solar system had to include sunlight, liquid water and the bunching together of various precursor molecules. But even today we read that water in the liquid form is an essential ingredient for life. But are ice layers themselves truly a handicap to the notion of thriving life?In the 1960's three groups of American scientists, at Wyeth Laboratories in Radnor, Pa., Cornell University and the University of British Columbia, showed that many biochemical reactions typical of living cells occur faster in ice than in liquid water. These include such key reactions as hydrolysis, peroxide decomposition, amino acid polymerization and enzymatic reactions."

The last meal I had at Nadaman Hakubai began with sake served in an ice blue glass bottle snuggled into a bowl of ice next to a single orchid blossom. In this case, the covered black lacquer bowl contained a single shrimp and a section of a corn cob, hollowed out and filled with homemade tofu. The other bowl was a disappointment: the toro ( fatty tuna ) was sinewy and tough, not buttery and delicate as it should have been.

McDonald's Corp adds Fallon McElligott to its agency roster to create ads for its Arch Deluxe adult burger (M) ,"A SECOND agency is suddenly taking a bite out of the Arch Deluxe. Early this year, the McDonald's Corporation added to its agency roster Fallon McElligott, the creative hot shop in Minneapolis. But a television commercial for Arch Deluxe that began appearing this week, titled'' Chef Andrew,'' was produced not by Fallon McElligott but by DDB Needham Chicago. One Fallon McElligott commercial depicted a classroom of youngsters reacting disdainfully to the mere mention of the Arch Deluxe. The Arch Deluxe continues to be an extremely important assignment for us.''Two more brand image commercials from Fallon McElligott, which ran for a week before the Summer Olympics, are now returning to television, Mr. Stoddart said.

Not even for Judge Kaye. Like everyone else, she sat through the program of jury orientation ( including a swell new movie starring Ed Bradley, Diane Sawyer and Judge Kaye herself ).

I served on a jury where there were no chairs in the deliberation room.''This time, Ms. Goodheart was struck by the opposite."

Lawrence Dershowitz Op-Ed article says high-profile conviction of Lazard Freres &amp; Co municipal bond trader Mark S Ferber should cause concern among everyone who cares about civil liberties since prosecution was based on novel theories; drawing (M) ,"Before anyone can be criminally prosecuted, both the alleged criminal conduct and the penalty must be spelled out unambiguously in a plainly worded criminal statute understandable to the average citizen. Yet that is precisely what occurred in the Ferber case: professionals were guessing until the moment of the verdict as to whether the jury would buy the prosecution's creative theory of criminal fraud. This problem of criminal law keeping pace with new developments was exemplified by a decision written by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. But criminal prosecution should not be used as the vehicle for creating crimes. Ferber did not have the fair warning that his questionable conduct was also criminal conduct."
Article discusses role being played by acting Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig in trying to forge labor peace with players union (M) ,"The telephone in Bud Selig's office rang busy yesterday, offering the best indication that a new labor agreement between the owners and the players will come to fruition. Optimists on the owners' side saw the possibility of an agreement early next week. The time Selig spent on the telephone was significant. If eight of those owners were to vote against a proposed deal, baseball would continue to labor without a labor agreement. Among other reasons, Selig is expected to prevail because of the personal suasion he has with other owners. None of the club owners or officials have been willing to comment on the service time issue or any aspect of the negotiations."
Editorial lauds new rule unanimously adopted by Federal Communications Commission requiring television broadcasters to provide three hours of educational programs for children each week (S) ,"The agreement resulted partly from pressure from the White House, which hopes to identify itself with family values in the Presidential campaign. The Children's Television Act of 1990 was supposed to raise quality, limiting advertising minutes and requiring broadcasters to provide more educational and informational programs. Spurred by more than 250 members of Congress and by President Clinton, who sponsored a recent White House conference on children's television, broadcasters agreed to provide three hours of programming a week ( averaged over six months ) targeted to the educational needs of children 16 years and under. P.M.The agreement gives broadcasters some flexibility to pre-empt the educational programs and to count specials, public-service announcements and some regularly scheduled programs with an educational component as part of the mix."
"Vignettes of scene in Jackson, Wyo, where Pres Clinton and family are spending summer vacation (Reporter's Notebook); photo (M) ","Here in the crystalline splendors of the Tetons, President Clinton has played many roles on his vacation this week: golfer, hiker, horseback rider, armchair astronomer.

Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, has instructed his staff not to comment about discussions with Mr. McDougal.

Bobby McDaniel, a lawyer for Mrs. McDougal, said today that his client would not strike a plea bargain."
