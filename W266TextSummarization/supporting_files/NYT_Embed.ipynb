      "TEXT: When federal prosecutors found in 1995 that Sharpe James, then the mayor of Newark, could not account for hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from political patrons, his only penalty was a $44,000 fine from the state election commission.Two years later, Mr. James's chief of staff was imprisoned for accepting bribes from city contractors. The mayor praised him as ''a loyal public servant'' and escaped from that investigation unscathed, soon winning a second public office as state senator.And throughout his five terms at the helm of New Jersey's largest city, Mr. James lived a lifestyle so lavish -- complete with a beach house, 54-foot yacht and Rolls-Royce -- that he was frequently the focus of accusations and insinuations, but he never faced a criminal charge.Now Mr. James, who left office last summer after 20 years at Newark City Hall, has been told by federal prosecutors that he is likely to face indictment on charges that he misused his city credit card to pay for personal expenses and allowed his friends and campaign contributors to buy tens of millions of dollars in municipal property at deeply discounted prices.Despite Mr. James's record of avoiding legal sanctions, this case poses a formidable threat. Thousands of pages of financial documents, credit card receipts and other city records have been subpoenaed by the United States attorney. Federal agents have also been investigating aides and associates of the former mayor who profited from the land deals, some of whom might cooperate now that Mr. James is out of office.''He's flaunted so much wealth for so long, and skirted so close to the line that it's no surprise he's under investigation,'' said Joseph R. Marbach, a political science professor at Seton Hall University. ''But he's been so savvy in how he's handled himself, and portrayed himself politically, that a lot of people wonder if the U.S. attorney will be able to meet the high standard necessary for criminal charges.''The United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie Jr., has declined to speak about the investigation, as have Mr. James and his lawyer, Raymond M. Brown. But Mr. James's son John said in an interview this week that he was confident that his father had done nothing improper.''In the end, I think people will see that everything he did, he did to help the city,'' John James said. ''When he left office, the real estate market was finally starting to percolate. There were $500,000 houses going up on vacant lots that had been sitting there growing weeds since the riots 40 years ago. Without him, none of this redevelopment would have happened. And when this is all over, history will show he was an excellent mayor who helped rebuild this city.''A Newark native who worked as a track coach and physical education teacher before entering politics, Mr. James was elected mayor in 1986 and quickly established a reputation as an energetic cheerleader for a struggling city. Using salesmanship and political savvy, Mr. James helped assemble the public financing and private support that led to construction of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the downtown stadium and the hockey arena, three shiny landmarks in a downtown that was once little more than a case study in blight.He also built a political machine that was on display each February at his lavish birthday parties. In exchange for Champagne and cake, city employees, vendors and political supporters were expected to make donations to the Sharpe James Civic Association, which massed some $3 million over eight years.That money was the focus of the federal investigation that ended in 1995. When he was cleared, Mr. James, who is African-American, charged that the inquiry was racially motivated and attributed his personal wealth to wise investments.In the years that followed, critics say, Mr. James seemed emboldened as he enjoyed the perks of his office, expanded his real estate portfolio and orchestrated land deals that were a boon to his friends and allies.During his final year in office, for instance, Mr. James used a city credit card to charge $80,000 in expenses on everything from dinners at Hooter's restaurants to trips to Florida, Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Brazil. Last year, Mr. James and his lawyer told reporters those charges were legitimate business expenses incurred while trying to attract more development.But at least three city police officers who provided security for Mr. James have been questioned by federal investigators about whether those trips were for business or pleasure, according to Anthony Fusco, a lawyer who represented them.Mr. James's administration also sold hundreds of parcels of vacant city land to dozens of friends and supporters during his last three years in office for as little as $1 a square foot, when similar property had been appraised at $20 per square foot or more, according to city records and court documents.Among the buyers was Jackie R. Mattison, the former chief of staff who served a prison term for accepting bribes. Mr. Mattison's company bought more than 30 city lots for millions of dollars below their appraised value.Tamika Rile, a woman who accompanied Mr. James on several trips, also bought cut-rate city properties, paying a total of $46,000 and selling them within two years for more than $700,000, according to city and county land records. Nothing in the publicly available documents indicates that Mr. James was directly involved in, or received a personal benefit from, the discounted land sales, which were approved by the City Council.But he did collect campaign contributions from the developers who profited from the deals shortly before or afterward. When the city's new mayor-elect, Cory A. Booker, sued in May 2006 to halt the sales, a state judge blocked 70 deals that were in progress, noting that the timing of those donations was troubling.Mr. James and his family have also received mortgages at below-market interest rates from a bank whose officers were allowed to buy millions of dollars of cut-rate city property.In recent years, Mr. Christie and other prosecutors have pressed political corruption charges by using a statute known as mail fraud/honest services, which is violated whenever elected officials use their positions to benefit a concealed financial interest rather than the public.''Sharpe James has been cheating the taxpayers for years,'' said Candace Straight, a Republican fund-raiser. ''If this case leads to charges and a sentence, it'll be long overdue.''POLITICAL MEMO\n",

      "TEXT: There is the yelp, an electronic yodel that grabs attention at intersections or kicks off chases. There is the wail, more traditional; it sounds like the windup police sirens of yore. There is the ''hi-lo,'' dubbed the ''European'' siren by some, because it evokes the police chases seen -- and heard -- in French and Italian films.The air-horn siren works well, officers say, for clearing intersections of pedestrians and getting the attention of speeding drivers. And the fast, or priority, siren sounds like an asteroid blaster from an old video game, and feels like a jackhammer assault on the ears.That is the menu of sirens available to New York City police officers, each one making a specific impression, each at an officer's fingertips. The sirens allow officers to choose sounds with a personal touch, like the conductors of a screeching, sound-bending orchestra.And there is something new. Christened with a tantalizing name, the Rumbler, it sends out low, bone-rattling vibrations, so it is not only heard, but also felt. One has been tested on the streets of New York, but the jury is out on whether it is effective, offensive or terrifying.Taken together, the sirens of the Police Department provide a remarkable -- as well as cacophonous -- audio record of policing today.Every time you hear that distinct and invasive wail, which may not technically be a wail, chances are the police officer behind it has made a deliberate, even aesthetic choice.The decision is wholly subjective; there are no guidelines. Officers are simply told to mix the sirens up.On a recent spin around Manhattan, up the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and then down the West Side Highway, Officer Spiros Komis, who has been with the highway patrol for 20 years, offered up an aural palette of what sirens he uses, and when. What would he do if he were chasing a speeding driver?''I go through the whole mode,'' he said, his fingers hovering above a dash-mounted keyboard that controls a police car's lights and sounds.''But I might start with a wail,'' he said, pressing a button. The air filled with a familiar nasal drone. ''And then I'd go to a constant yelp,'' he said, and the car began bleating. A red Acura driving ahead promptly pulled right, into the center lane, its driver nervously checking his speed. ''Then I'd give a little bit of the air horn; I'd give it a little toot,'' he said, and gave it a little toot.''Most highway officers hit the air horn,'' he said. A gray Toyota RAV4 that had taken the Acura's place ahead of the squad car quickly swung out of the way, too, as its driver stared fixedly ahead. The car in front of the RAV4, a gray Volvo, also pulled out of the way.''Like a hot knife through butter,'' Officer Komis said, satisfied.But sometimes sirens have no effect, no matter what they sound like.''Elderly people are trickier,'' Officer Komis said. ''You might need to pull out the public address system. And an individual attempting to flee is not going to respond to anything.''New York officers face stiff competition from other sounds, and few people are more accustomed to a constant assault on the ears than New Yorkers. Wearers of iPods are cocooned behind personal walls of sound, and drivers are snug inside hermetically sealed luxury cars.Summer presents its own challenges: Car windows are up, air-conditioners blast and music usually does, too. Then there are cellphones, the near-constant honking of horns and all the other sirens: fire trucks, ambulances and so on.''You live in New York, there's too many sirens,'' said Lt. Luis Perez, the commanding officer of the Police Department's driver education and training unit. ''We just hear too much.''Police departments began using manual windup sirens early in the last century, and models with electrical motors around the Depression years. In the early 1970s, manufacturers introduced sirens with different patterns and frequencies, to address a growing problem: Officers in different police cars using the same frequency often could not hear each other when approaching the same intersection, a dreaded phenomenon known as the wash-out effect that is a recipe for a crash. The yelp, the wail, the fast and the hi-lo sirens were born.During their four-day drivers' training courses, police recruits are taught the importance of mixing up sirens. New police officers also tend to overestimate the power their sirens have, said Officer Daniel Donza, a driver trainer.Another trainer, Officer Paul Cacioppo, said, ''You can never be visible enough or heard enough.'' (Still, officers are not allowed to use the siren without good reason. If they do, they can lose vacation days.)Now comes the Rumbler. Maybe.To experience it is to feel a little earthquake beneath one's feet.Robert S. Martinez, director of the department's fleet services unit, says the Rumbler has brought pedestrians and traffic to a dead stop every time he has tried out the test model. Departments in Alexandria, Va., and elsewhere in the Washington area already have Rumblers, according to Tom Morgan of Federal Signal, a leading siren supplier. It works like a bass-heavy boombox, sending out vibrations through two woofers.But though the Rumbler is bound to grab the attention of even the most jaded New Yorker, it may frighten too many people, Mr. Martinez said.''It's debatable whether this would be good or bad for New York City,'' he said. ''You don't want to hurt people's ears. Even though it's a lower decibel, it almost seems offensive.''\n",

      "TEXT: Cloaking one's identity while writing -- to hide, in other words, in order to reveal -- is an old literary tradition. Mary Ann Evans used the gender-crossing pseudonym George Eliot to publish ''Adam Bede'' in 1859, when female authors still struggled to be taken seriously. Charlotte Bronte released ''Jane Eyre'' in 1847 under the name Currer Bell.What, then, of the complex case of JT Leroy, the pseudonymous writer with the titillating past, a supposed child of a truck-stop prostitute who rocketed to fame in 2000 with the publication of ''Sarah,'' a novel of poverty and sexual abuse set among the grease-stained highway rest stops of West Virginia?Mr. Leroy seemed at first to be a hot commodity in today's biography-obsessed literary world, a gifted writer with a grotesquely compelling story that only enhanced the value of the work. After years of celebrity that included friendships with Winona Ryder and Madonna, articles in The New York Times and Vanity Fair, and many other gaudy trappings of early 21st century fame, JT Leroy was revealed to be the name not of a writer -- in fact, not even of a person -- but of the fictive alter ego of Laura Albert, a mother and otherwise obscure young novelist from Brooklyn Heights.This intricate game of hide-and-seek with its interlocking issues of identity, fame, money and the healing power of art has now leapt from the media to what is arguably the culture's second most obsessive arena: the courts. A film production company has sued Ms. Albert for fraud, saying that a contract signed with JT Leroy to make a feature film of ''Sarah'' should be null and void, for the simple reason that JT Leroy does not exist.At its heart, the case revolves around the contract, signed by Antidote International Films Inc. (producer of, among other movies, ''Laurel Canyon'' and ''Thirteen'') and Ms. Albert's company, Underdogs Inc., to option the film rights to ''Sarah'' in 2003. Underdogs was paid $15,000 under the contract, which was renewed, at the same rate of $15,000, for each of the next two years. Antidote is suing for its money back.Along with tales of commerce, the jury was treated yesterday to a bit of culture: A lawyer for the defendant referred in his opening remarks to the O. Henry story ''The Last Leaf'' moments after the plaintiff's lawyer played a recording of Terry Gross interviewing someone posing as JT Leroy on NPR's ''Fresh Air.'' The trial, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, promises to be an Escher-like convergence of the movies, literature and journalism with references to sex in truck stops thrown in and a documentary filmmaker, considering a project on the case, sitting quietly in back.Gregory Curtner, a lawyer for Antidote, opened the trial by painting a broad picture of JT Leroy's supposed rise from Appalachian misery to stardom. The son of a truck-stop prostitute, the jury learned, JT Leroy (according to the stories concocted on his behalf) would sit in parked cars or at a diner while his mother turned tricks. He himself eventually turned to prostitution and, after finally picking up a pen to describe his ordeal, tried to peddle his early works to agents, publishers and the like by sending faxes from gas station bathrooms.It was this hardscrabble ''life'' that caught the attention of a director, Steven Shainberg, who wanted to work with Antidote and blend elements of JT Leroy's biography into the narrative of ''Sarah'' in what Mr. Curtner called a film about ''how art could emerge from a ruined childhood.'' The trouble was there was no ruined childhood from which art could actually emerge.Or at least not one that belonged to the imaginary JT Leroy. Ms. Albert's lawyer, Eric Weinstein, began his own remarks with the memorably understated line, ''Laura is a complicated person.'' He said she was physically and sexually abused as a child. He said she was institutionalized in psychiatric wards and in a group home as a ward of the state. He said she was in therapy for 13 years with a psychiatrist whom she spoke to by telephone while posing as a teenage boy named Jeremy, an embryonic version of JT Leroy.By the time the psychiatrist advised her to write, the persona of the teenage boy had become engrained as Ms. Albert's alter ego, what Mr. Weinstein called her ''bridge to the world.'' Ms. Albert herself, in conversations before the trial, called JT ''her respirator,'' an unreal, though entirely necessary, entity that allowed her to breathe.As movie people say, the ''inciting incident'' of the lawsuit came with the publication in late 2005 of an article in New York magazine that questioned JT Leroy's identity. The Times followed with an article in February that identified Ms. Albert as the true author of ''Sarah.''The producers at Antidote were stunned; they were also worried that the commercial prospects of their project might crumble. As Mr. Curtner put it: ''The whole autobiographical back story aura that made this so attractive was a sham.''Mr. Weinstein told the jury that the contract with Antidote was for a book, not a back story, and that the film company could have made the movie no matter who wrote the novel. He then went on to suggest that the project was in freefall (a bad screenplay) and that Antidote had used the excuse of disputed authorship as an escape hatch.It was at this point that the sort of lemonade-from-literary-lemons notion that can exist only in Hollywood was introduced. Mr. Weinstein said the director, Mr. Shainberg, decided he would now make a new film, something in the vein of ''Adaptation'' or ''Being John Malkovich,'' a ''meta-film'' that mixed the novel with the lives of its real and purported authors in a project touted in-house as ''Sarah Plus.''But that required obtaining the rights to Ms. Albert's story -- a story of such apparent darkness that she herself had required a literary doppleg&#xE4;nger to tell it.She refused to grant the rights. ''And that,'' Mr. Weinstein said, ''is why we find ourselves here.''\n",

      "TEXT: Mike Keiser, who made a fortune selling greeting cards on recycled paper, turned this remote spot on the southern Oregon coast into a golfing mecca that attracts wealthy people in private jets from around the world.To many in this hard-luck town of 3,000, Mr. Keiser is an economic hero. Work became scarce after the timber and fishing industries collapsed a quarter-century ago, and his Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, a few miles north of town, has created 325 full-time jobs, plus hundreds more part-time jobs. Mr. Keiser earns millions of dollars in profits each year.But beneath this model of enterprise, largely hidden subsidies from airline passengers, state-lottery players, taxpayers and company shareholders support the benefits that the owner, workers and visitors at Bandon Dunes enjoy.Airline passengers and lottery players are paying for a $31 million airport expansion to serve the 5,000 business jets that arrive each year, filled almost entirely with golfers. Many of them are executives of publicly traded companies flying at a small fraction of the real cost of their trips; taxpayers and shareholders bear nearly all of these costs.Much controversy swirls around the subsidies and tax exemptions state and local governments offer expressly to attract businesses to a community. But far less attention has been focused on the many kinds of indirect favors that are showered on places like Bandon Dunes through government policies that influence the flow of money from the public to private interests and often serve to reinforce benefits for those who are already successful.''In every situation, governments need to ask what the necessary public role is,'' said Irene S. Rubin, a public finance expert at Northern Illinois University. ''Why is the government even involved in this activity? What is the public good?''No official tally of business subsidies exists, but in separate studies Peter S. Fisher of the University of Iowa and Kenneth F. Thomas of the University of Missouri estimated that state and local subsidies aimed at creating jobs total about $50 billion annually. More subtle subsidies like those that benefit Bandon Dunes are not counted in those figures and may be even larger.Such government subsidies have been challenged as inefficient by a broad spectrum of critics, from the libertarian Cato Institute and the conservative Heritage Foundation to liberal groups like Good Jobs First.To be sure, said Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard University economics professor and a former chief economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan, some government subsidies can be beneficial for society.''A subsidy for flu vaccines is good,'' he said, ''because if you are vaccinated I am less likely to get flu by contagion.'' But job subsidies are a drag on the economy, he added, ''unless the local gain exceeds the loss in the rest of the nation.''In the beginning, there were no subsidies at Bandon Dunes. That stands in contrast to many projects where state and local agencies compete to attract investments in factories, corporate headquarters and other developments that claim to create or retain jobs.''I am the sole owner -- no one else would have invested,'' said Mr. Keiser, who paid $2.4 million, half the asking price, for his first parcel of scrub land in 1990. The country may seem overrun with golf courses, but Mr. Keiser had something else in mind. He calls it ''dream golf,'' modeled after the age-old seaside links in Scotland where the game was invented.Tens of thousands of golfers now come each year, many in corporate jets, to play on three courses, all considered among the best in the world. They lie on the sandy bluffs above the Pacific Ocean, with no power poles, no traffic and no whine from electric golf carts, because players must walk, carrying their own bags or relying on caddies to help them navigate the course. Stiff winds carry balls unpredictably; wet weather is common.Bandon Dunes has become extraordinarily popular. This year about 120,000 rounds of golf will be played, at a typical cost in season of more than $200 a person. Lodging and meals add hundreds more to the expense. Among the visitors have been Bill Gates, Michael Jordan and Don Johnson.After the resort was built without government aid, the first subsidy was put in place only after Mr. Keiser's lawyers succeeded in eliminating for three years the larger property-tax bill that would normally accompany new construction -- a tax break worth $99,000 this year.John Griffith, the Coos County commission chairman, complained that the tax cut had been sought after the decision was made to invest. ''It is supposed to be an incentive to attract new investment, not a reward for an investment you have already decided to make,'' said Mr. Griffith, who was almost alone among public officials in opposing the subsidy. The incentive was supported by the others as a means of rewarding Mr. Keiser for his investment in the area.The city of Bandon also allowed Mr. Keiser to buy into a proposed reservoir project, which would produce water for the town and for another golf course he may build south of here. The project requires condemnation of land, which can be done only by a government agency.But those two relatively modest government subsidies pale in comparison to the support for private jets that has made the resort far more accessible. About 20 miles north of Bandon Dunes lies an airport, which handles only three commercial flights a day. The airport was originally created to serve planes guarding the coast during World War II.Before the first golf course opened in 1999, perhaps three private jets a year landed here, said Gary W. LeTellier, the airport director. Last year 5,000 private jets came; the number should grow to as many as 7,500 once the expansion is completed, Mr. LeTellier said.The airport expansion is being financed by a tax paid on all commercial airline tickets and state bonds backed by revenue from the Oregon lottery, which is heavily used by the state's poor.Even if the planned growth of the resort leads to a doubling of the full-time payroll to 650, the airport expansion alone represents a one-time cost to taxpayers of almost $48,000 a job. The average pay for a full-time Bandon Dunes worker, including benefits and tips, is about $36,000.The biggest subsidy is even more hidden, a consequence of the rules under which executives make personal use of company jets. Most executives do not pay directly; instead the value of the flights is supposed to be counted as income.In most cases, the executive's only expense is higher income taxes. Some companies reimburse executives for these taxes and even pay the taxes on the reimbursement.Moreover, under current government rules, the income attributed to personal use of such jets is only a fraction of the real cost. Take a trip that costs a company $100,000. Of that, $35,000 is borne by the federal government because such expenses are tax deductible. The other $65,000 is borne by shareholders in the form of lower profits.Yet the executive owes no more than a few thousand dollars in taxes. That's because to calculate income taxes on personal flights, the government counts only a portion of costs, excluding, among other things, flights to position a plane or fly it home empty.Based on the number of corporate jets flying here, an average four-hour flight time and total costs of $4,000 per hour, the subsidy from taxpayers works out to about $12 million, with shareholders effectively paying about twice that. For the 325 existing jobs, that adds up to an annual total of $37,000 a job.Michael Greenstone, a professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the subsidy is a significant boon to Mr. Keiser and his customers, sharply reducing the expense of reaching such a remote location.As the owner of a private business, Mr. Keiser personally bears the full cost of the leased Gulfstream 200 that brings him from his home in Chicago to Bandon Dunes roughly every six weeks. The resort never asked for the tax subsidy for executives, he said. And if taken away, he added, ''I think that it would have negligible impact on us.''''Certainly from the recipient point of view,'' Mr. Keiser said, ''I'm pleased that there is a subsidy and know very well that it is a subsidy that can be changed at any point in time. That is why we have a Congress, to look at things like that.''\n",
