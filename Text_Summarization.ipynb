      "body is  American Airlines is expected to announce today that it is buying 40 wide-bodied aircraft - 25 from Airbus Industrie and 15 from the Boeing Company - and 80 engines from the General Electric Company to power the aircraft.American Airlines is expected to announce today that it is buying 40 wide-bodied aircraft - 25 from Airbus Industrie and 15 from the Boeing Company - and 80 engines from the General Electric Company to power the aircraft.Industry sources said the orders would total $2.5 billion.American split the order between the two aircraft manufacturers as part of an effort to get a better price and conditions, but it decided to give the engine order to one manufacturer, the sources said.The order of 80 CF6-80C2 engines, worth more than $5 million apiece, is the largest order of commercial aircraft engines ever received by G. E. It is expected to strengthen the company's lead over its rival in the big-engine market, Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of the United Technologies Corporation. With parts included, the engine order is worth about $500 million. G. E. Victory Called SubstantialAnalysts said that G.E.'s victory was substantial but that the loss was not devastating to Pratt &amp; Whitney and its PW4000 engines. Both companies are racing to power the more fuel-efficient wide-bodied jets that airlines throughout the world are busily ordering.''It's a significant order, and American Airlines is an influential customer,'' said Robert Kugel, an aerosapce analyst for Morgan Stanley &amp; Company. In the race so far, G. E. has surpassed Pratt &amp; Whitney in orders for the engines by 2 to 1, one industry source estimated.The order was also considered a boost for Airbus, which in the United States until now has been able to sell its planes mostly to weaker carriers such as Eastern Airlines. Airbus Industries, which was created in 1970, links together the main aerospace companies of France, West Germany, Britain and Spain. It has become a force in the world's commercial airplane market. Stock PricesOn the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, G.E.'s stock price rose 37.5 cents, to $103.75, while Boeing's fell $1, to $53.25, and United Technologies' was down 87.5 cents, to $53.75.Industry sources said that the engines would be made by G.E. at its plant in Evandale, Ohio, near Cincinnati.The planes themselves go for about $50 million apiece, meaning that Airbus would get $1.25 billion, and Boeing $750 million. It was not clear when American would receive the new planes.Mr. Kugel said that splitting the plane order showed that Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of AMR Corporation, the parent of American, and its managment were ''very canny traders.'' Unusual Conditions of OrderIndustry sources said that the conditions of the order were unusual in that the planes were being acquired under a ''lease to buy'' arrangement in which American can return the planes to the manufacturers on short notice.An industry source said, however, that American could not simply walk away and give back the planes - that it had to meet certain conditions and that there were financial penalties.Nevertheless, Tassos Philipakkos, the aerospace analyst for Moody's Investor Service, said that the ability to give the planes back considerably increased the risk to the manufacturers, who could suddenly find themselves with a surplus of planes to sell.''It's very unusual, at a time when the demand for aircraft is so strong, to have a buyers' market,'' he said. ''You would think it would be much more balanced.''Mr. Kugel added, however, that the chances of American returning planes were remote since it was a financially strong carrier and it would have to be in serious trouble to back off from its ambitious plans to expand its service, particularly in international markets.The planes are long-range versions of the A300 and the Boeing 767. The A300's have a range of 4,500 miles and will seat about 265 passengers, while the 767's have a range of 6,680 miles and will be able to seat 215. American's Expansion of RoutesAmerican has been seeking to expand its international routes and will soon begin serving Paris and Frankfurt from its hub at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.The airline has also been seeking to expand further its international service, having fallen behind its main competitor, United Airlines, which in one move last year expanded into the Pacific by acquiring routes from Pan American World Airways.American has looked at the possibility of buying Pan Am, which has an extensive route network between the United States, Europe and other parts of the world. Recently American said it was not interested in buying Pan Am as a whole, but it was intrested in acquiring some of its assets. Some analysts believe that American is still very interested in acquiring international routes from Pan Am but that it decided it would be less risky and cheaper to buy them from the carrier rather than taking it over.One analyst, who did not want his name used, said that the purchase of the planes, which could all fly the trans-Atlantic routes, would put American in a good position to expand quickly in such markets if the routes become available through a selloff by Pan Am. Unlike domestic routes, where carriers can fly where they want if airport restrictions are not a problem, international routes typically are acquired by complex and long negotiations and can take decades to assemble.'\n",

Last April, a Presidential commission on organized crime said the Mafia remains a dominant force in an underworld that makes $ 100 billion a year. Giuliani cautioned that the decline of the Mafia did not mean the end of organized crime. Those prosecutions have disrupted the management of the mafia, he said. Further, prosecutors are pursuing efforts under Federal racketeering laws to seize the assets of the Mafia. The problems facing the Mafia are compounded by the improved status of Italian-Americans, he said.\n",
