# Part A
a_1_distribution: (0+k)/(0+kV)=1/V.
a_1_depends_on_k: No.
a_2_good_estimate: Not good. we can do better 
a_3_pqba: Your answer.  k/( C  + kV).
a_4_which_context: context b has higher probability.
a_5_which_should: context a should have higher probability.

# Part C
# c_1: include c1.png in this directory with your derivation. included.
c_2_which_case: b
c_2_why: case b because it is easiler to predict.

# Part E
e_1_average_count_per_trigram_ignoring_zero_counts: document length / vocabulary
e_1_average_count_per_trigram_including_zero_counts: document length / vocabulary
e_2_brown: {5}

a_1_cell_func: "h = (0+k)/(0+kV)=1/V."
a_1_parameters: something with HH + HH
a_2_embedding_parameters: VH
a_2_output_parameters: HV
a_3_single_target_word: 2H
a_3_full_distribution_of_all_target_words: 2HV
a_4_with_sampled_softmax: 2Hk
a_4_with_hierarchical_softmax: 2H
a_5_slowest_part: {recurrent}

c_1_explain_run_epoch: This function is running different epochs so as to use gradient descent to reduce loss and fine tune the parameters. The role of batch iterator and h help to iterate different batches within a single epoch.

d_1_number_agreement: Te boy and the girl is" is more plausible because the model gives more weight to "the girl
d_2_semantic_agreement: "vegetable" is more plausible than "nut" in the first sentence and "eat" is more plausible than "drink" in the second sentence.

d_3_JJ_order: A 3-gram model should perform the same in the 2 examples as the first 3 words are not directly related to the predicted word in both senteces. 
A 5-gram model should perform the same in the first example but different in the second example as "hungery" is more likely to be related with "eat"
